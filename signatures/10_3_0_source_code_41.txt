    If nonce is ``None``, a new 16-byte nonce is generated.
    aadd_aes_modesa_create_cipherasysamodulesuCryptodome.Cipher.AESuCreate a new AES cipher.

    Args:
      key(bytes/bytearray/memoryview):
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.

        It must be 16 (*AES-128)*, 24 (*AES-192*) or 32 (*AES-256*) bytes long.

        For ``MODE_SIV`` only, it doubles to 32, 48, or 64 bytes.
      mode (a ``MODE_*`` constant):
        The chaining mode to use for encryption or decryption.
        If in doubt, use ``MODE_EAX``.

    Keyword Args:
      iv (bytes/bytearray/memoryview):
        (Only applicable for ``MODE_CBC``, ``MODE_CFB``, ``MODE_OFB``,
        and ``MODE_OPENPGP`` modes).

        The initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.

        For ``MODE_CBC``, ``MODE_CFB``, and ``MODE_OFB`` it must be 16 bytes long.

        For ``MODE_OPENPGP`` mode only,
        it must be 16 bytes long for encryption
        and 18 bytes for decryption (in the latter case, it is
        actually the *encrypted* IV which was prefixed to the ciphertext).

        If not provided, a random byte string is generated (you must then
        read its value with the :attr:`iv` attribute).

      nonce (bytes/bytearray/memoryview):
        (Only applicable for ``MODE_CCM``, ``MODE_EAX``, ``MODE_GCM``,
        ``MODE_SIV``, ``MODE_OCB``, and ``MODE_CTR``).

        A value that must never be reused for any other encryption done
        with this key (except possibly for ``MODE_SIV``, see below).

        For ``MODE_EAX``, ``MODE_GCM`` and ``MODE_SIV`` there are no
        restrictions on its length (recommended: **16** bytes).

        For ``MODE_CCM``, its length must be in the range **[7..13]**.
        Bear in mind that with CCM there is a trade-off between nonce
        length and maximum message size. Recommendation: **11** bytes.

        For ``MODE_OCB``, its length must be in the range **[1..15]**
        (recommended: **15**).

        For ``MODE_CTR``, its length must be in the range **[0..15]**
        (recommended: **8**).

        For ``MODE_SIV``, the nonce is optional, if it is not specified,
        then no nonce is being used, which renders the encryption
        deterministic.

        If not provided, for modes other than ``MODE_SIV``, a random
        byte string of the recommended length is used (you must then
        read its value with the :attr:`nonce` attribute).

      segment_size (integer):
        (Only ``MODE_CFB``).The number of **bits** the plaintext and ciphertext
        are segmented in. It must be a multiple of 8.
        If not specified, it will be assumed to be 8.

      mac_len (integer):
        (Only ``MODE_EAX``, ``MODE_GCM``, ``MODE_OCB``, ``MODE_CCM``)
        Length of the authentication tag, in bytes.

        It must be even and in the range **[4..16]**.
        The recommended value (and the default, if not specified) is **16**.

      msg_len (integer):
        (Only ``MODE_CCM``). Length of the message to (de)cipher.
        If not specified, ``encrypt`` must be called with the entire message.
        Similarly, ``decrypt`` can only be called once.

      assoc_len (integer):
        (Only ``MODE_CCM``). Length of the associated data.
        If not specified, all associated data is buffered internally,
        which may represent a problem for very large messages.

      initial_value (integer or bytes/bytearray/memoryview):
        (Only ``MODE_CTR``).
        The initial value for the counter. If not present, the cipher will
        start counting from 0. The value is incremented by one for each block.
        The counter number is encoded in big endian mode.

      counter (object):
        (Only ``MODE_CTR``).
        Instance of ``Cryptodome.Util.Counter``, which allows full customization
        of the counter block. This parameter is incompatible to both ``nonce``
        and ``initial_value``.

      use_aesni: (boolean):
        Use Intel AES-NI hardware extensions (default: use if available).

    Returns:
        an AES object, of the applicable mode.

            **The IV must be unpredictable**. Ideally it is picked randomly.

        A cipher object is stateful: once you have encrypted a message
        you cannot encrypt (or decrypt) another message using the same
        object.

        The data to encrypt can be broken up in two or
        more pieces and `encrypt` can be called multiple times.

        That is, the statement:

            >>> c.encrypt(a) + c.encrypt(b)

        is equivalent to:

             >>> c.encrypt(a+b)

        That also means that you cannot reuse an object for encrypting
        or decrypting other data with the same key.

        This function does not add any padding to the plaintext.

        :Parameters:
          plaintext : bytes/bytearray/memoryview
            The piece of data to encrypt.
            Its lenght must be multiple of the cipher block size.

        However, the receiver is still able to detect any modification to it.

    :Parameters:
      factory : module
        A symmetric cipher module from `Cryptodome.Cipher` (like
        `Cryptodome.Cipher.AES`).

    :Keywords:
      key : bytes/bytearray/memoryview
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.

      nonce : bytes/bytearray/memoryview
        A value that must never be reused for any other encryption.

        Its length must be in the range ``[7..13]``.
        11 or 12 bytes are reasonable values in general. Bear in
        mind that with CCM there is a trade-off between nonce length and
        maximum message size.

        If not specified, a 11 byte long random string is used.

      mac_len : integer
        Length of the MAC, in bytes. It must be even and in
        the range ``[4..16]``. The default is 16.

      msg_len : integer
        Length of the message to (de)cipher.
        If not specified, ``encrypt`` or ``decrypt`` may only be called once.

      assoc_len : integer
        Length of the associated data.

    This is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (`AEAD`_) mode.
    It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

    The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed, and it will
    still be subject to authentication. The decryption step tells the receiver
    if the message comes from a source that really knowns the secret key.
    Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message - including the
    header - has been modified or corrupted.

    This mode requires a nonce. The nonce shall never repeat for two
    different messages encrypted with the same key, but it does not need
    to be random.
    Note that there is a trade-off between the size of the nonce and the
    maximum size of a single message you can encrypt.

    It is important to use a large nonce if the key is reused across several
    messages and the nonce is chosen randomly.

    It is acceptable to us a short nonce if the key is only used a few times or
    if the nonce is taken from a counter.

    The following table shows the trade-off when the nonce is chosen at
    random. The column on the left shows how many messages it takes
    for the keystream to repeat **on average**. In practice, you will want to
    stop using the key way before that.

    Plaintext and ciphertext are processed in *segments*

    :Parameters:

        The underlying block cipher, a module from ``Cryptodome.Cipher``.

    :Keywords:
      nonce : bytes/bytearray/memoryview
        The fixed part at the beginning of the counter block - the rest is
        the counter number that gets increased when processing the next block.
        The nonce must be such that no two messages are encrypted under the
        same key and the same nonce.

        The nonce must be shorter than the block size (it can have
        zero length; the counter is then as long as the block).

        If this parameter is not present, a random nonce will be created with
        length equal to half the block size. No random nonce shorter than
        64 bits will be created though - you must really think through all
        security consequences of using such a short block size.

      initial_value : posive integer or bytes/bytearray/memoryview
        The initial value for the counter. If not present, the cipher will
        start counting from 0. The value is incremented by one for each block.
        The counter number is encoded in big endian mode.

      counter : object
        Instance of ``Cryptodome.Util.Counter``, which allows full customization
        of the counter block. This parameter is incompatible to both ``nonce``
        and ``initial_value``.

    Any other keyword will be passed to the underlying block cipher.
    See the relevant documentation for details (at least ``key`` will need
    to be present).

    This mode is very similar to ECB, in that
    encryption of one block is done independently of all other blocks.

    Unlike ECB, the block *position* contributes to the encryption
    and no information leaks about symbol frequency.

    Each message block is associated to a *counter* which
    must be unique across all messages that get encrypted
    with the same key (not just within the same message).
    The counter is as big as the block size.

    Counters can be generated in several ways. The most
    straightword one is to choose an *initial counter block*
    (which can be made public, similarly to the *IV* for the
    other modes) and increment its lowest **m** bits by one
    (modulo *2^m*) for each block. In most cases, **m** is
    chosen to be half the block size.

    See `NIST SP800-38A`_, Section 6.5 (for the mode) and
    Appendix B (for how to manage the *initial counter block*).

        If there is any associated data, the caller has to invoke
        this function one or more times, before using
        ``decrypt`` or ``encrypt``.

        By *associated data* it is meant any data (e.g. packet headers) that
        will not be encrypted and will be transmitted in the clear.
        However, the receiver is still able to detect any modification to it.

        If there is no associated data, this method must not be called.

        The caller may split associated data in segments of any size, and
        invoke this method multiple times, each time with the next segment.

    This is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
    (`AEAD`_) mode. It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

    The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed,
    and it will still be subject to authentication.

    The decryption step tells the receiver if the message comes
    from a source that really knowns the secret key.
    Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message -
    including the header - has been modified or corrupted.

    This mode requires a *nonce*.

    This mode is only available for ciphers that operate on 64 or
    128 bits blocks.

    There are no official standards defining EAX.
    The implementation is based on `a proposal`__ that
    was presented to NIST.

    This is the simplest encryption mode. Each of the plaintext blocks
    is directly encrypted into a ciphertext block, independently of
    any other block.

    This mode is dangerous because it exposes frequency of symbols
    in your plaintext. Other modes (e.g. *CBC*) should be used instead.

    This is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (`AEAD`_) mode.
    It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

    The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed, and it will
    still be subject to authentication. The decryption step tells the receiver
    if the message comes from a source that really knowns the secret key.
    Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message - including the
    header - has been modified or corrupted.

    This mode requires a *nonce*.

    This mode is only available for ciphers that operate on 128 bits blocks
    (e.g. AES but not TDES).

Offset Codebook (OCB) mode.

OCB is Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) cipher mode
designed by Prof. Phillip Rogaway and specified in `RFC7253`_.

The algorithm provides both authenticity and privacy, it is very efficient,
it uses only one key and it can be used in online mode (so that encryption
or decryption can start before the end of the message is available).

This module implements the third and last variant of OCB (OCB3) and it only
works in combination with a 128-bit block symmetric cipher, like AES.

OCB is patented in US but `free licenses`_ exist for software implementations
meant for non-military purposes.

Example:
    >>> from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
    >>> from Cryptodome.Random import get_random_bytes
    >>>
    >>> key = get_random_bytes(32)
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_OCB)
    >>> plaintext = b"Attack at dawn"
    >>> ciphertext, mac = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)
    >>> # Deliver cipher.nonce, ciphertext and mac
    ...
    >>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_OCB, nonce=nonce)
    >>> try:
    >>>     plaintext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, mac)
    >>> except ValueError:
    >>>     print "Invalid message"
    >>> else:
    >>>     print plaintext

        A cipher object is stateful: once you have encrypted a message

        That is, the statement:

    This mode is a variant of CFB, and it is only used in PGP and

    An Initialization Vector (*IV*) is required.

    Unlike CFB, the *encrypted* IV (not the IV itself) is
    transmitted to the receiver.

    The IV is a random data block. For legacy reasons, two of its bytes are
    duplicated to act as a checksum for the correctness of the key, which is now
    known to be insecure and is ignored. The encrypted IV is therefore 2 bytes
    longer than the clean IV.

    This is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (`AEAD`_) mode.
    It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

    The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed, and it will
    still be subject to authentication. The decryption step tells the receiver
    if the message comes from a source that really knowns the secret key.
    Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message - including the
    header - has been modified or corrupted.

    Unlike other AEAD modes such as CCM, EAX or GCM, accidental reuse of a
    nonce is not catastrophic for the confidentiality of the message. The only
    effect is that an attacker can tell when the same plaintext (and same
    associated data) is protected with the same key.

    The length of the MAC is fixed to the block size of the underlying cipher.
    The key size is twice the length of the key of the underlying cipher.

    This mode is only available for AES ciphers.

    This function performs key derivation according to an old version of
    the PKCS#5 standard (v1.5) or `RFC2898
    <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt>`_.

    Args:
     password (string):
        The secret password to generate the key from.
     salt (byte string):
        An 8 byte string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
        This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
        chosen for each derivation.
     dkLen (integer):
        The length of the desired key. The default is 16 bytes, suitable for
        instance for :mod:`Cryptodome.Cipher.AES`.
     count (integer):
        The number of iterations to carry out. The recommendation is 1000 or
        more.
     hashAlgo (module):
        The hash algorithm to use, as a module or an object from the :mod:`Cryptodome.Hash` package.
        The digest length must be no shorter than ``dkLen``.
        The default algorithm is :mod:`Cryptodome.Hash.SHA1`.

    Return:
        A byte string of length ``dkLen`` that can be used as key.

    This function performs key derivation according to the PKCS#5 standard (v2.0).

    Args:
     password (string or byte string):
        The secret password to generate the key from.

        Strings will be encoded as ISO 8859-1 (also known as Latin-1),
        which does not allow any characters with codepoints > 255.
     salt (string or byte string):
        A (byte) string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
        This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
        chosen for each derivation. It is recommended to use at least 16 bytes.

        Strings will be encoded as ISO 8859-1 (also known as Latin-1),
        which does not allow any characters with codepoints > 255.
     dkLen (integer):
        The cumulative length of the keys to produce.

        Due to a flaw in the PBKDF2 design, you should not request more bytes
        than the ``prf`` can output. For instance, ``dkLen`` should not exceed
        20 bytes in combination with ``HMAC-SHA1``.
     count (integer):
        The number of iterations to carry out. The higher the value, the slower
        and the more secure the function becomes.

        You should find the maximum number of iterations that keeps the
        key derivation still acceptable on the slowest hardware you must support.

        Although the default value is 1000, **it is recommended to use at least
        1000000 (1 million) iterations**.
     prf (callable):
        A pseudorandom function. It must be a function that returns a
        pseudorandom byte string from two parameters: a secret and a salt.
        The slower the algorithm, the more secure the derivation function.
        If not specified, **HMAC-SHA1** is used.
     hmac_hash_module (module):
        A module from ``Cryptodome.Hash`` implementing a Merkle-Damgard cryptographic
        hash, which PBKDF2 must use in combination with HMAC.
        This parameter is mutually exclusive with ``prf``.

    Return:
        A byte string of length ``dkLen`` that can be used as key material.
        If you want multiple keys, just break up this string into segments of the desired length.

    Return a random strong *N*-bit prime number.
    In this context, *p* is a strong prime if *p-1* and *p+1* have at
    least one large prime factor.

    Args:
        N (integer): the exact length of the strong prime.
          It must be a multiple of 128 and > 512.
        e (integer): if provided, the returned prime (minus 1)
          will be coprime to *e* and thus suitable for RSA where
          *e* is the public exponent.
        false_positive_prob (float):
          The statistical probability for the result not to be actually a
          prime. It defaults to 10\ :sup:`-6`.
          Note that the real probability of a false-positive is far less. This is

          Note that the real probability of a false-positive is far less.

          a random byte string of such length.
          If omitted, :func:`Cryptodome.Random.get_random_bytes` is used.

    Return:
        `True` is the input is indeed prime.
    uValues must be non-negativeabsrainsertu>Qg+l@lu>Iql u>BldcalstripTduConvert a positive integer to a byte string using big endian encoding.

    If :data:`blocksize` is absent or zero, the byte string will
    be of minimal length.

    Otherwise, the length of the byte string is guaranteed to be a multiple
    of :data:`blocksize`. If necessary, zeroes (``\x00``) are added at the left.

    .. note::
        In Python 3, if you are sure that :data:`n` can fit into
        :data:`blocksize` bytes, you can simply use the native method instead::

            >>> n.to_bytes(blocksize, 'big')

        For instance::

            >>> n = 80
            >>> n.to_bytes(2, 'big')
            b'\x00P'

        However, and unlike this ``long_to_bytes()`` function,
        an ``OverflowError`` exception is raised if :data:`n` does not fit.
    aunpackaaccwsvConvert a byte string to a long integer (big endian).

    In Python 3.2+, use the native method instead::

        >>> int.from_bytes(s, 'big')

    For instance::

        >>> int.from_bytes(b'P', 'big')
        80

    This is (essentially) the inverse of :func:`long_to_bytes`.

    in a certain interval [start:seq]uCompatibility code for handling string/bytes changes from Python 2.x to Py3k

In Python 2.x, strings (of type ''str'') contain binary data, including encoded
Unicode text (e.g. UTF-8).  The separate type ''unicode'' holds Unicode text.
Unicode literals are specified via the u'...' prefix.  Indexing or slicing
either type always produces a string of the same type as the original.
Data read from a file is always of '''str'' type.

In Python 3.x, strings (type ''str'') may only contain Unicode text. The u'...'
prefix and the ''unicode'' type are now redundant.  A new type (called
''bytes'') has to be used for binary data (including any particular
''encoding'' of a string).  The b'...' prefix allows one to specify a binary
literal.  Indexing or slicing a string produces another string.  Slicing a byte
string produces another byte string, but the indexing operation produces an
integer.  Data read from a file is of '''str'' type if the file was opened in
text mode, or of ''bytes'' type otherwise.

Since PyCryptodome aims at supporting both Python 2.x and 3.x, the following helper
functions are used to keep the rest of the library as independent as possible
from the actual Python version.

In general, the code should always deal with binary strings, and use integers
instead of 1-byte character strings.

b(s)
    Take a text string literal (with no prefix or with u'...' prefix) and
    make a byte string.
bchr(c)
    Take an integer and make a 1-character byte string.
bord(c)
    Take the result of indexing on a byte string and make an integer.
tobytes(s)
    Take a text string, a byte string, or a sequence of character taken from
    a byte string and make a byte string.

        :param callback: The Python callback to use.  This must accept three
            positional arguments.  First, an integer giving the maximum length

            which will be true if the user should be prompted for the
            passphrase twice and the callback should verify that the two values
            supplied are equal. Third, the value given as the *userdata*
            parameter to :meth:`set_passwd_cb`.  The *callback* must return

        Specify that the platform provided CA certificates are to be used for
        verification purposes. This method has some caveats related to the
        binary wheels that cryptography (pyOpenSSL's primary dependency) ships:

        *   macOS will only load certificates using this method if the user has
            the ``openssl@1.1`` `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ formula installed
            in the default location.
        *   Windows will not work.
        *   manylinux cryptography wheels will work on most common Linux
            distributions in pyOpenSSL 17.1.0 and above.  pyOpenSSL detects the
            manylinux wheel and attempts to load roots via a fallback path.

        Default verify paths are based on the compiled version of OpenSSL.
        However, when pyca/cryptography is compiled as a manylinux wheel
        that compiled location can potentially be wrong. So, like Go, we
        will try a predefined set of paths and attempt to load roots

        aSSL_versionu
        Retrieve the SSL or TLS protocol version of the current connection.

        :returns: The TLS version of the current connection.  For example,
            it will return ``0x769`` for connections made over TLS version 1.
        :rtype: :class:`int`
        aSSL_set_alpn_protosu
        Specify the client's ALPN protocol list.

        These protocols are offered to the server during protocol negotiation.

        :param protos: A list of the protocols to be offered to the server.
            This list should be a Python list of bytestrings representing the
            protocols to offer, e.g. ``[b'http/1.1', b'spdy/2']``.
        uConnection.set_alpn_protos.<locals>.<genexpr>Tuunsigned int *aSSL_get0_alpn_selectedu
        Get the protocol that was negotiated by ALPN.

        :returns: A bytestring of the protocol name.  If no protocol has been
            negotiated yet, returns an empty bytestring.
        aSSL_set_tlsext_status_typeaTLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocspu
        Called to request that the server sends stapled OCSP data, if
        available. If this is not called on the client side then the server
        will not send OCSP data. Should be used in conjunction with
        :meth:`Context.set_ocsp_client_callback`.

    An error occurred in an `OpenSSL.SSL` API.
    a__orig_bases__u
    A base class for wrapper classes that allow for intelligent exception
    handling in OpenSSL callbacks.

    :ivar list _problems: Any exceptions that occurred while executing in a
        context where they could not be raised in the normal way.  Typically
        this is because OpenSSL has called into some Python code and requires a
        return value.  The exceptions are saved to be raised later when it is
        possible to do so.
    u_CallbackExceptionHelper.__init__u_CallbackExceptionHelper.raise_if_problemu
    Wrap a callback such that it can be used as a certificate verification
    callback.
    u_VerifyHelper.__init__u
    Wrap a callback such that it can be used as an ALPN selection callback.
    u_ALPNSelectHelper.__init__u
    Wrap a callback such that it can be used as an OCSP callback for the server
    side.

    Annoyingly, OpenSSL defines one OCSP callback but uses it in two different
    ways. For servers, that callback is expected to retrieve some OCSP data and
    hand it to OpenSSL, and may return only SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK,
    SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_FATAL, and SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK. For clients, that callback
    is expected to check the OCSP data, and returns a negative value on error,
    0 if the response is not acceptable, or positive if it is. These are
    mutually exclusive return code behaviours, and they mean that we need two
    helpers so that we always return an appropriate error code if the user's
    code throws an exception.

    Given that we have to have two helpers anyway, these helpers are a bit more
    helpery than most: specifically, they hide a few more of the OpenSSL
    functions so that the user has an easier time writing these callbacks.

    This helper implements the server side.
    u_OCSPServerCallbackHelper.__init__u
    Wrap a callback such that it can be used as an OCSP callback for the client
    side.

    by the return value, and an error code is stored in an error queue
    associated with the current thread. The err library provides functions to
    obtain these error codes and textual error messages.

The 'backend' argument is used to

        a_cdefTaoverrideapackedapackuParse the given C source.  This registers all declared functions,
        types, and global variables.  The functions and global variables can
        then be accessed via either 'ffi.dlopen()' or 'ffi.verify()'.
        The types can be used in 'ffi.new()' and other functions.
        If 'packed' is specified as True, all structs declared inside this
        cdef are packed, i.e. laid out without any field alignment at all.
        Alternatively, 'pack' can be a small integer, and requests for
        alignment greater than that are ignored (pack=1 is equivalent to
        packed=True).

        The standard C library can be loaded by passing None.
        Note that functions and types declared by 'ffi.cdef()' are not
        linked to a particular library, just like C headers; in the
        library we only look for the actual (untyped) symbols.
        a__cffi_close__uClose a library obtained with ffi.dlopen().  After this call,
        access to functions or variables from the library will fail
        (possibly with a segmentation fault).

        a_typeoffsetofuReturn the offset of the named field inside the given
        structure or array, which must be given as a C type name.
        You can give several field names in case of nested structures.
        You can also give numeric values which correspond to array
        items, in case of an array type.
        anewpuAllocate an instance according to the specified C type and
        return a pointer to it.  The specified C type must be either a
        pointer or an array: ``new('X *')`` allocates an X and returns
        a pointer to it, whereas ``new('X[n]')`` allocates an array of
        n X'es and returns an array referencing it (which works
        mostly like a pointer, like in C).  You can also use
        ``new('X[]', n)`` to allocate an array of a non-constant
        length n.

        The memory is initialized following the rules of declaring a
        global variable in C: by default it is zero-initialized, but
        an explicit initializer can be given which can be used to
        fill all or part of the memory.

        When the returned <cdata> object goes out of scope, the memory
        is freed.  In other words the returned <cdata> object has
        ownership of the value of type 'cdecl' that it points to.  This
        means that the raw data can be used as long as this object is
        kept alive, but must not be used for a longer time.  Be careful
        about that when copying the pointer to the memory somewhere
        else, e.g. into another structure.
        anew_allocatorTnaallocateuFFI.new_allocator.<locals>.allocateuReturn a new allocator, i.e. a function that behaves like ffi.new()
        but uses the provided low-level 'alloc' and 'free' functions.

        'alloc' is called with the size as argument.  If it returns NULL, a
        MemoryError is raised.  'free' is called with the result of 'alloc'
        as argument.  Both can be either Python function or directly C
        functions.  If 'free' is None, then no free function is called.
        If both 'alloc' and 'free' are None, the default is used.

        If 'should_clear_after_alloc' is set to False, then the memory
        returned by 'alloc' is assumed to be already cleared (or you are
        fine with garbage); otherwise CFFI will clear it.
        aallocatoruSimilar to a C cast: returns an instance of the named C
        type initialized with the given 'source'.  The source is
        casted between integers or pointers of any type.
        astringuReturn a Python string (or unicode string) from the 'cdata'.
        If 'cdata' is a pointer or array of characters or bytes, returns
        the null-terminated string.  The returned string extends until
        the first null character, or at most 'maxlen' characters.  If
        'cdata' is an array then 'maxlen' defaults to its length.

        If 'cdata' is a pointer or array of wchar_t, returns a unicode
        string following the same rules.

        If 'cdata' is a single character or byte or a wchar_t, returns
        it as a string or unicode string.

        If 'cdata' is an enum, returns the value of the enumerator as a
        string, or 'NUMBER' if the value is out of range.
        aunpackuUnpack an array of C data of the given length,
        returning a Python string/unicode/list.

        If 'cdata' is a pointer to 'char', returns a byte string.
        It does not stop at the first null.  This is equivalent to:
        ffi.buffer(cdata, length)[:]

        If 'cdata' is a pointer to 'wchar_t', returns a unicode string.
        'length' is measured in wchar_t's; it is not the size in bytes.

        If 'cdata' is a pointer to anything else, returns a list of
        'length' items.  This is a faster equivalent to:
        [cdata[i] for i in range(length)]
        a_unspecifiedafrom_bufferuReturn a cdata of the given type pointing to the data of the
        given Python object, which must support the buffer interface.
        Note that this is not meant to be used on the built-in types
        str or unicode (you can build 'char[]' arrays explicitly)
        but only on objects containing large quantities of raw data
        in some other format, like 'array.array' or numpy arrays.

        The first argument is optional and default to 'char[]'.
        amemmoveuffi.memmove(dest, src, n) copies n bytes of memory from src to dest.

        Like the C function memmove(), the memory areas may overlap;
        apart from that it behaves like the C function memcpy().

        'src' can be any cdata ptr or array, or any Python buffer object.
        'dest' can be any cdata ptr or array, or a writable Python buffer
        object.  The size to copy, 'n', is always measured in bytes.

        Unlike other methods, this one supports all Python buffer including
        byte strings and bytearrays---but it still does not support
        non-contiguous buffers.
        acallback_decorator_wrapuFFI.callback.<locals>.callback_decorator_wrapDaconsider_function_as_funcptrtuReturn a callback object or a decorator making such a
        callback object.  'cdecl' must name a C function pointer type.
        The callback invokes the specified 'python_callable' (which may
        be provided either directly or via a decorator).  Important: the
        callback object must be manually kept alive for as long as the
        callback may be invoked from the C level.
        acallableuthe 'python_callable' argument is not callableacallbackaerroraonerrorastripTw*u&[agetcnamew&u(%s)u[(w areplace_withuReturn a string giving the C type 'cdecl', which may be itself
        a string or a <ctype> object.  If 'replace_with' is given, it gives
        extra text to append (or insert for more complicated C types), like
        a variable name, or '*' to get actually the C type 'pointer-to-cdecl'.
        agcpuReturn a new cdata object that points to the same
        data.  Later, when this new cdata object is garbage-collected,
        'destructor(old_cdata_object)' will be called.

        The optional 'size' gives an estimate of the size, used to
        trigger the garbage collection more eagerly.  So far only used
        on PyPy.  It tells the GC that the returned object keeps alive
        roughly 'size' bytes of external memory.
        aacquireTFaget_cached_btypeaverifierTaVerifiera_caller_dir_pycacheaVerifiera_caller_dir_pycachea_apply_windows_unicodeakwargsaload_libraryuVerify that the current ffi signatures compile on this
        machine, and return a dynamic library object.  The dynamic
        library can be used to call functions and access global
        variables declared in this 'ffi'.  The library is compiled
        by the C compiler: it gives you C-level API compatibility
        (including calling macros).  This is unlike 'ffi.dlopen()',
        which requires binary compatibility in the signatures.
        aget_errnoaset_errnoagetwinerrorapointer_cachea__addressof__akindapointeruaddressof(pointer)a_pointer_toactypearawaddressofuReturn the address of a <cdata 'struct-or-union'>.
        If 'fields_or_indexes' are given, returns the address of that
        field or array item in the structure or array, recursively in
        case of nested structures.
        atypeoffsetofaoffsetuffi.include() expects an argument that is also of type cffi.FFI, not %ra__name__uself.include(self)aincludeTw[aextendTw]uIncludes the typedefs, structs, unions and enums defined
        in another FFI instance.  Usage is similar to a #include in C,
        where a part of the program might include types defined in
        another part for its own usage.  Note that the include()
        method has no effect on functions, constants and global
        variables, which must anyway be accessed directly from the
        lib object returned by the original FFI instance.

        declare these types to be (pointers to) plain 8-bit characters.
        This is mostly for backward compatibility; you usually want True.

    Usage
        ...
        ffibuilder.set_source("_foo", pkgconfig = ["libfoo", "libbar >= 1.8.3"])

    If pkg-config is installed on build machine, then arguments include_dirs,
    library_dirs, libraries, define_macros, extra_compile_args and
    extra_link_args are extended with an output of pkg-config for libfoo and
    libbar.

    Raises PkgConfigError in case the pkg-config call fails.

    Given a raw bytes sequence, return the best possibles charset usable to render str objects.
    If there is no results, it is a strong indicator that the source is binary/not text.
    By default, the process will extract 5 blocks of 512o each to assess the mess and coherence of a given sequence.
    And will give up a particular code page after 20% of measured mess. Those criteria are customizable at will.

    The preemptive behavior DOES NOT replace the traditional detection workflow, it prioritize a particular code page
    but never take it for granted. Can improve the performance.

    You may want to focus your attention to some code page or/and not others, use cp_isolation and cp_exclusion for that
    purpose.

    This function will strip the SIG in the payload/sequence every time except on UTF-16, UTF-32.
    By default the library does not setup any handler other than the NullHandler, if you choose to set the 'explain'
    toggle to True it will alter the logger configuration to add a StreamHandler that is suitable for debugging.
    Custom logging format and handler can be set manually.

    The result is a ratio between 0. (absolutely no correspondence) and 1. (near perfect fit).
    Beware that is function is not strict on the match in order to ease the detection. (Meaning close match is 1.)

Charset-Normalizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Real First Universal Charset Detector.
A library that helps you read text from an unknown charset encoding.
Motivated by chardet, This package is trying to resolve the issue by taking a new approach.
All IANA character set names for which the Python core library provides codecs are supported.

Basic usage:
   >>> from charset_normalizer import from_bytes
   >>> results = from_bytes('Bсеки човек има право на образование. Oбразованието!'.encode('utf_8'))
   >>> best_guess = results.best()
   >>> str(best_guess)
   'Bсеки човек има право на образование. Oбразованието!'

Others methods and usages are available - see the full documentation

        buffer like a bytearray, and yields a null-terminated version of that
        data. This is required because PKCS12_parse doesn't take a length with
        its password char * and ffi.from_buffer doesn't provide null
        termination. So, to support zeroing the data via bytearray we
        need to build this ridiculous construct that copies the memory, but
        zeroes it after use.

        An X.509 name is a two-level structure: a list of sets of attributes.
        Each list element is separated by ',' and within each list element, set
        elements are separated by '+'. The latter is almost never used in
        real world certificates. According to RFC4514 section 2.1 the
        RDNSequence must be reversed when converting to string representation.

        According to RFC4514 section 2.1 the RDNSequence must be

Consider running `gcloud config set project` or setting the %s environment variablea_CLOUD_SDK_MISSING_CREDENTIALSuGets the default credentials for the current environment.

    `Application Default Credentials`_ provides an easy way to obtain
    credentials to call Google APIs for server-to-server or local applications.
    This function acquires credentials from the environment in the following
    order:

    1. If the environment variable ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is set
       to the path of a valid service account JSON private key file, then it is
       loaded and returned. The project ID returned is the project ID defined
       in the service account file if available (some older files do not
       contain project ID information).

       If the environment variable is set to the path of a valid external
       account JSON configuration file (workload identity federation), then the
       configuration file is used to determine and retrieve the external
       credentials from the current environment (AWS, Azure, etc).
       These will then be exchanged for Google access tokens via the Google STS
       endpoint.
       The project ID returned in this case is the one corresponding to the
       underlying workload identity pool resource if determinable.

       If the environment variable is set to the path of a valid GDCH service
       account JSON file (`Google Distributed Cloud Hosted`_), then a GDCH
       credential will be returned. The project ID returned is the project
       specified in the JSON file.
    2. If the `Google Cloud SDK`_ is installed and has application default
       credentials set they are loaded and returned.

       To enable application default credentials with the Cloud SDK run::

            gcloud auth application-default login

       If the Cloud SDK has an active project, the project ID is returned. The
       active project can be set using::

            gcloud config set project

    3. If the application is running in the `App Engine standard environment`_
       (first generation) then the credentials and project ID from the
       `App Identity Service`_ are used.
    4. If the application is running in `Compute Engine`_ or `Cloud Run`_ or
       the `App Engine flexible environment`_ or the `App Engine standard
       environment`_ (second generation) then the credentials and project ID
       are obtained from the `Metadata Service`_.
    5. If no credentials are found,
       :class:`~google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` will be raised.

        uAWS Credentials and AWS Signature V4 Request Signer.

This module provides credentials to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon
Web Services (AWS) workloads. These credentials are recommended over the
use of service account credentials in AWS as they do not involve the management
of long-live service account private keys.

AWS Credentials are initialized using external_account arguments which are
typically loaded from the external credentials JSON file.
Unlike other Credentials that can be initialized with a list of explicit
arguments, secrets or credentials, external account clients use the
environment and hints/guidelines provided by the external_account JSON
file to retrieve credentials and exchange them for Google access tokens.

This module also provides a basic implementation of the
`AWS Signature Version 4`_ request signing algorithm.

AWS Credentials use serialized signed requests to the
`AWS STS GetCallerIdentity`_ API that can be exchanged for Google access tokens
via the GCP STS endpoint.

    This helper function is useful when you do not know (or care to know) the
    specific type of credentials you are using (such as when you use
    :func:`google.auth.default`). This function will call
    :meth:`Scoped.with_scopes` if the credentials are scoped credentials and if
    the credentials require scoping. Otherwise, it will return the credentials
    as-is.

    Args:
        credentials (google.auth.credentials.Credentials): The credentials to
            scope if necessary.
        scopes (Sequence[str]): The list of scopes to use.

            Google client library. Use 'scopes' for user-defined scopes.

    Returns:

            credentials, or the passed in credentials instance if no scoping
            was required.

    All credentials have a :attr:`token` that is used for authentication and
    may also optionally set an :attr:`expiry` to indicate when the token will
    no longer be valid.

    Most credentials will be :attr:`invalid` until :meth:`refresh` is called.
    Credentials can do this automatically before the first HTTP request in
    :meth:`before_request`.

    Although the token and expiration will change as the credentials are
    :meth:`refreshed <refresh>` and used, credentials should be considered
    immutable. Various credentials will accept configuration such as private
    keys, scopes, and other options. These options are not changeable after
    construction. Some classes will provide mechanisms to copy the credentials
    with modifications such as :meth:`ScopedCredentials.with_scopes`.

    uCryptography helpers for verifying and signing messages.

The simplest way to verify signatures is using :func:`verify_signature`::

    cert = open('certs.pem').read()
    valid = crypt.verify_signature(message, signature, cert)

If you're going to verify many messages with the same certificate, you can use
:class:`RSAVerifier`::

    cert = open('certs.pem').read()
    verifier = crypt.RSAVerifier.from_string(cert)
    valid = verifier.verify(message, signature)

To sign messages use :class:`RSASigner` with a private key::

    private_key = open('private_key.pem').read()
    signer = crypt.RSASigner.from_string(private_key)
    signature = signer.sign(message)

The code above also works for :class:`ES256Signer` and :class:`ES256Verifier`.
Note that these two classes are only available if your `cryptography` dependency
version is at least 1.4.0.

        uExternal Account Credentials.

This module provides credentials that exchange workload identity pool external
credentials for Google access tokens. This facilitates accessing Google Cloud
Platform resources from on-prem and non-Google Cloud platforms (e.g. AWS,
Microsoft Azure, OIDC identity providers), using native credentials retrieved
from the current environment without the need to copy, save and manage
long-lived service account credentials.

Specifically, this is intended to use access tokens acquired using the GCP STS
token exchange endpoint following the `OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange`_ spec.

This module provides credentials based on OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens.
These credentials usually access resources on behalf of a user (resource
owner).

Specifically, these are sourced using external identities via Workforce Identity Federation.

Obtaining the initial access and refresh token can be done through the Google Cloud CLI.

        uIdentity Pool Credentials.

This module provides credentials to access Google Cloud resources from on-prem
or non-Google Cloud platforms which support external credentials (e.g. OIDC ID
tokens) retrieved from local file locations or local servers. This includes
Microsoft Azure and OIDC identity providers (e.g. K8s workloads registered with
Hub with Hub workload identity enabled).

These credentials are recommended over the use of service account credentials
in on-prem/non-Google Cloud platforms as they do not involve the management of
long-live service account private keys.

Identity Pool Credentials are initialized using external_account
arguments which are typically loaded from an external credentials file or
an external credentials URL. Unlike other Credentials that can be initialized
with a list of explicit arguments, secrets or credentials, external account
clients use the environment and hints/guidelines provided by the
external_account JSON file to retrieve credentials and exchange them for Google
access tokens.

This module provides authentication for applications where local credentials
impersonates a remote service account using `IAM Credentials API`_.

This class can be used to impersonate a service account as long as the original
Credential object has the "Service Account Token Creator" role on the target
service account.

    impersonated identities.

    Impersonated Credentials allows credentials issued to a user or
    service account to impersonate another. The target service account must
    grant the originating credential principal the
    `Service Account Token Creator`_ IAM role:

    For more information about Token Creator IAM role and
    IAMCredentials API, see
    `Creating Short-Lived Service Account Credentials`_.

    .. _Creating Short-Lived Service Account Credentials:
        https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials

    Usage:

    First grant source_credentials the `Service Account Token Creator`
    role on the target account to impersonate.   In this example, the
    service account represented by svc_account.json has the
    token creator role on
    `impersonated-account@_project_.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

    Enable the IAMCredentials API on the source project:
    `gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com`.

    Initialize a source credential which does not have access to
    list bucket::

        from google.oauth2 import service_account

        target_scopes = [
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only']

        source_credentials = (
            service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
                '/path/to/svc_account.json',
                scopes=target_scopes))

    Now use the source credentials to acquire credentials to impersonate
    another service account::

        from google.auth import impersonated_credentials

        target_credentials = impersonated_credentials.Credentials(
          source_credentials=source_credentials,
          target_principal='impersonated-account@_project_.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
          target_scopes = target_scopes,
          lifetime=500)

    Resource access is granted::

        client = storage.Client(credentials=target_credentials)
        buckets = client.list_buckets(project='your_project')
        for bucket in buckets:

Provides support for creating (encoding) and verifying (decoding) JWTs,
especially JWTs generated and consumed by Google infrastructure.

See `rfc7519`_ for more details on JWTs.

To encode a JWT use :func:`encode`::

    from google.auth import crypt
    from google.auth import jwt

    signer = crypt.Signer(private_key)
    payload = {'some': 'payload'}
    encoded = jwt.encode(signer, payload)

To decode a JWT and verify claims use :func:`decode`::

    claims = jwt.decode(encoded, certs=public_certs)

You can also skip verification::

    claims = jwt.decode(encoded, verify=False)

    These credentials require an "audience" claim. This claim identifies the
    intended recipient of the bearer token.

    The constructor arguments determine the claims for the JWT that is
    sent with requests. Usually, you'll construct these credentials with
    one of the helper constructors as shown in the next section.

    To create JWT credentials using a Google service account private key
    JSON file::

        audience = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Publisher'
        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json',
            audience=audience)

    If you already have the service account file loaded and parsed::

        service_account_info = json.load(open('service_account.json'))
        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
            service_account_info,
            audience=audience)

    Both helper methods pass on arguments to the constructor, so you can
    specify the JWT claims::

        credentials = jwt.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json',
            audience=audience,
            additional_claims={'meta': 'data'})

    You can also construct the credentials directly if you have a
    :class:`~google.auth.crypt.Signer` instance::

        credentials = jwt.Credentials(
            signer,
            issuer='your-issuer',
            subject='your-subject',
            audience=audience)

    The claims are considered immutable. If you want to modify the claims,
    you can easily create another instance using :meth:`with_claims`::

        new_audience = (
            'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber')
        new_credentials = credentials.with_claims(audience=new_audience)

    Like :class:`Credentials`, this class uses a JWT as the bearer token for
    authentication. However, this class does not require the audience at
    construction time. Instead, it will generate a new token on-demand for
    each request using the request URI as the audience. It caches tokens
    so that multiple requests to the same URI do not incur the overhead
    of generating a new token every time.

    This behavior is especially useful for `gRPC`_ clients. A gRPC service may
    have multiple audience and gRPC clients may not know all of the audiences
    required for accessing a particular service. With these credentials,
    no knowledge of the audiences is required ahead of time.

Pluggable Credentials are initialized using external_account arguments which
are typically loaded from third-party executables. Unlike other
credentials that can be initialized with a list of explicit arguments, secrets
or credentials, external account clients use the environment and hints/guidelines
provided by the external_account JSON file to retrieve credentials and exchange
them for Google access tokens.

Example credential_source for pluggable credential:
{
    "executable": {
        "command": "/path/to/get/credentials.sh --arg1=value1 --arg2=value2",
        "timeout_millis": 5000,
        "output_file": "/path/to/generated/cached/credentials"
    }

    passphrase protected private key in order to estalish mutual TLS channel.

    For example, if you have a function which produces client cert, passphrase

        uTransport - HTTP client library support.

:mod:`google.auth` is designed to work with various HTTP client libraries such
as urllib3 and requests. In order to work across these libraries with different
interfaces some abstraction is needed.

This module provides two interfaces that are implemented by transport adapters
to support HTTP libraries. :class:`Request` defines the interface expected by
:mod:`google.auth` to make requests. :class:`Response` defines the interface
for the return value of :class:`Request`.

        Args:
            timeout (Optional[Union[float, Tuple[float, float]]]):
                The amount of time in seconds to wait for the server response
                with each individual request. Can also be passed as a tuple
                ``(connect_timeout, read_timeout)``. See :meth:`requests.Session.request`
                documentation for details.
            max_allowed_time (Optional[float]):
                If the method runs longer than this, a ``Timeout`` exception is
                automatically raised. Unlike the ``timeout`` parameter, this
                value applies to the total method execution time, even if
                multiple requests are made under the hood.

                Mind that it is not guaranteed that the timeout error is raised
                at ``max_allowed_time``. It might take longer, for example, if
                an underlying request takes a lot of time, but the request
                itself does not timeout, e.g. if a large file is being
                transmitted. The timout error will be raised after such
                request completes.

    A TransportAdapter that enables mutual TLS and offloads the client side
    signing operation to the signing library.

    Args:
        enterprise_cert_file_path (str): the path to a enterprise cert JSON
            file. The file should contain the following field:

                {
                    "libs": {
                        "signer_library": "...",

                    }
                }

    Raises:

    u_MutualTlsOffloadAdapter.__init__u_MutualTlsOffloadAdapter.init_poolmanageru_MutualTlsOffloadAdapter.proxy_manager_foruA Requests Session class with credentials.

    This class is used to perform requests to API endpoints that require
    authorization::

        from google.auth.transport.requests import AuthorizedSession

        authed_session = AuthorizedSession(credentials)

        response = authed_session.request(
            'GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b')


    The underlying :meth:`request` implementation handles adding the
    credentials' headers to the request and refreshing credentials as needed.

    This class also supports mutual TLS via :meth:`configure_mtls_channel`
    method. In order to use this method, the `GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`
    environment variable must be explicitly set to ``true``, otherwise it does
    nothing. Assume the environment is set to ``true``, the method behaves in the
    following manner:

    If client_cert_callback is provided, client certificate and private
    key are loaded using the callback; if client_cert_callback is None,
    application default SSL credentials will be used. Exceptions are raised if
    there are problems with the certificate, private key, or the loading process,
    so it should be called within a try/except block.

    First we set the environment variable to ``true``, then create an :class:`AuthorizedSession`
    instance and specify the endpoints::

        regular_endpoint = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{my_project_id}/topics'
        mtls_endpoint = 'https://pubsub.mtls.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{my_project_id}/topics'

        authed_session = AuthorizedSession(credentials)

    Now we can pass a callback to :meth:`configure_mtls_channel`::

        def my_cert_callback():
            # some code to load client cert bytes and private key bytes, both in
            # PEM format.
            some_code_to_load_client_cert_and_key()
            if loaded:
                return cert, key
            raise MyClientCertFailureException()

        # Always call configure_mtls_channel within a try/except block.
        try:
            authed_session.configure_mtls_channel(my_cert_callback)
        except:
            # handle exceptions.

        if authed_session.is_mtls:
            response = authed_session.request('GET', mtls_endpoint)
        else:
            response = authed_session.request('GET', regular_endpoint)


    You can alternatively use application default SSL credentials like this::

        try:
            authed_session.configure_mtls_channel()
        except:
            # handle exceptions.

            that credentials should be refreshed and the request should be
            retried.

            refresh the credentials and retry the request.
        refresh_timeout (Optional[int]): The timeout value in seconds for
            credential refresh HTTP requests.
        auth_request (google.auth.transport.requests.Request):

            :class:`~google.auth.transport.requests.Request` used when
            refreshing credentials. If not passed,

            is created.
        default_host (Optional[str]): A host like "pubsub.googleapis.com".
            This is used when a self-signed JWT is created from service

        arefreshaapplyuOAuth 2.0 Credentials.

This module provides credentials based on OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens.
These credentials usually access resources on behalf of a user (resource
owner).

Specifically, this is intended to use access tokens acquired using the
`Authorization Code grant`_ and can refresh those tokens using a
optional `refresh token`_.

Obtaining the initial access and refresh token is outside of the scope of this
module. Consult `rfc6749 section 4.1`_ for complete details on the
Authorization Code grant flow.

    Reauth is disabled by default. To enable reauth, set the
    `enable_reauth_refresh` parameter to True in the constructor. Note that
    reauth feature is intended for gcloud to use only.
    If reauth is enabled, `pyu2f` dependency has to be installed in order to use security

        https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/            announcing-google-distributed-cloud-edge-and-hosted

    To create a GDCH service account credential, first create a JSON file of
    the following format::

        {
            "type": "gdch_service_account",
            "format_version": "1",
            "project": "<project name>",
            "private_key_id": "<key id>",
            "private_key": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
<key bytes>
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
",
            "name": "<service identity name>",
            "ca_cert_path": "<CA cert path>",
            "token_uri": "https://service-identity.<Domain>/authenticate"
        }

    The "format_version" field stands for the format of the JSON file. For now
    it is always "1". The `private_key_id` and `private_key` is used for signing.
    The `ca_cert_path` is used for token server TLS certificate verification.

    After the JSON file is created, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
    variable to the JSON file path, then use the following code to create the
    credential::

        import google.auth

        credential, _ = google.auth.default()
        credential = credential.with_gdch_audience("<the audience>")

    We can also create the credential directly::

        from google.oauth import gdch_credentials

        credential = gdch_credentials.ServiceAccountCredentials.from_service_account_file("<the json file path>")
        credential = credential.with_gdch_audience("<the audience>")

    The token is obtained in the following way. This class first creates a
    self signed JWT. It uses the `name` value as the `iss` and `sub` claim, and
    the `token_uri` as the `aud` claim, and signs the JWT with the `private_key`.
    It then sends the JWT to the `token_uri` to exchange a final token for
    `audience`.

    uA module that provides functions for handling rapt authentication.

Reauth is a process of obtaining additional authentication (such as password,
security token, etc.) while refreshing OAuth 2.0 credentials for a user.

Credentials that use the Reauth flow must have the reauth scope,
``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/accounts.reauth``.

This module provides a high-level function for executing the Reauth process,
:func:`refresh_grant`, and lower-level helpers for doing the individual
steps of the reauth process.

Those steps are:

1. Obtaining a list of challenges from the reauth server.
2. Running through each challenge and sending the result back to the reauth
   server.
3. Refreshing the access token using the returned rapt token.

        2. Next we use the self signed jwt as the access token, and make a POST
        request to IAM generateIdToken endpoint. The request body is:
            {
                "audience": self._target_audience,

        If the request is succesfully, it will return {"token":"the ID token"},
        and we can extract the ID token and compute its expiry.
        a_refresh_with_iam_endpointaid_token_jwt_grantuService Accounts: JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0

This module implements the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants
as defined by `RFC 7523`_ with particular support for how this RFC is
implemented in Google's infrastructure. Google refers to these credentials
as *Service Accounts*.

Service accounts are used for server-to-server communication, such as
interactions between a web application server and a Google service. The
service account belongs to your application instead of to an individual end
user. In contrast to other OAuth 2.0 profiles, no users are involved and your
application "acts" as the service account.

Typically an application uses a service account when the application uses
Google APIs to work with its own data rather than a user's data. For example,
an application that uses Google Cloud Datastore for data persistence would use
a service account to authenticate its calls to the Google Cloud Datastore API.
However, an application that needs to access a user's Drive documents would
use the normal OAuth 2.0 profile.

Additionally, Google Apps domain administrators can grant service accounts
`domain-wide delegation`_ authority to access user data on behalf of users in
the domain.

This profile uses a JWT to acquire an OAuth 2.0 access token. The JWT is used
in place of the usual authorization token returned during the standard
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant. The JWT is only used for this purpose, as
the acquired access token is used as the bearer token when making requests
using these credentials.

This profile differs from normal OAuth 2.0 profile because no user consent
step is required. The use of the private key allows this profile to assert
identity directly.

This profile also differs from the :mod:`google.auth.jwt` authentication
because the JWT credentials use the JWT directly as the bearer token. This
profile instead only uses the JWT to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token. The
obtained OAuth 2.0 access token is used as the bearer token.

Domain-wide delegation
----------------------

Domain-wide delegation allows a service account to access user data on
behalf of any user in a Google Apps domain without consent from the user.
For example, an application that uses the Google Calendar API to add events to
the calendars of all users in a Google Apps domain would use a service account
to access the Google Calendar API on behalf of users.

The Google Apps administrator must explicitly authorize the service account to
do this. This authorization step is referred to as "delegating domain-wide
authority" to a service account.

You can use domain-wise delegation by creating a set of credentials with a
specific subject using :meth:`~Credentials.with_subject`.

    Usually, you'll create these credentials with one of the helper
    constructors. To create credentials using a Google service account
    private key JSON file::

        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json')

    Or if you already have the service account file loaded::

        service_account_info = json.load(open('service_account.json'))
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
            service_account_info)

    Both helper methods pass on arguments to the constructor, so you can
    specify additional scopes and a subject if necessary::

        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'service-account.json',
            scopes=['email'],
            subject='user@example.com')

    The credentials are considered immutable. If you want to modify the scopes
    or the subject used for delegation, use :meth:`with_scopes` or
    :meth:`with_subject`::

        scoped_credentials = credentials.with_scopes(['email'])
        delegated_credentials = credentials.with_subject(subject)

    To add a quota project, use :meth:`with_quota_project`::

    These credentials are largely similar to :class:`.Credentials`, but instead
    of using an OAuth 2.0 Access Token as the bearer token, they use an Open
    ID Connect ID Token as the bearer token. These credentials are useful when
    communicating to services that require ID Tokens and can not accept access
    tokens.

    Or if you already have the service account file loaded::

        service_account_info = json.load(open('service_account.json'))
        credentials = (
            service_account.IDTokenCredentials.from_service_account_info(

        uOAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Spec.

This module defines a token exchange utility based on the `OAuth 2.0 Token
Exchange`_ spec. This will be mainly used to exchange external credentials
for GCP access tokens in workload identity pools to access Google APIs.

The implementation will support various types of client authentication as
allowed in the spec.

A deviation on the spec will be for additional Google specific options that
cannot be easily mapped to parameters defined in the RFC.

The returned dictionary response will be based on the `rfc8693 section 2.2.1`_
spec JSON response.

    uOAuth 2.0 Utilities.

This module provides implementations for various OAuth 2.0 utilities.
This includes `OAuth error handling`_ and
`Client authentication for OAuth flows`_.

OAuth error handling
--------------------
This will define interfaces for handling OAuth related error responses as
stated in `RFC 6749 section 5.2`_.
This will include a common function to convert these HTTP error responses to a
:class:`google.auth.exceptions.OAuthError` exception.


Client authentication for OAuth flows
-------------------------------------
We introduce an interface for defining client authentication credentials based
on `RFC 6749 section 2.3.1`_. This will expose the following
capabilities:

    * Ability to support basic authentication via request header.
    * Ability to support bearer token authentication via request header.
    * Ability to support client ID / secret authentication via request body.

        This is the first step in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow. The user's
        browser should be redirected to the returned URL.

        This method calls
        :meth:`requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session.authorization_url`
        and specifies the client configuration's authorization URI (usually
        Google's authorization server) and specifies that "offline" access is
        desired. This is required in order to obtain a refresh token.

        Args:
            kwargs: Additional arguments passed through to
                :meth:`requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session.authorization_url`

        Returns:
            Tuple[str, str]: The generated authorization URL and state. The
                user must visit the URL to complete the flow. The state is used
                when completing the flow to verify that the request originated
                from your application. If your application is using a different
                :class:`Flow` instance to obtain the token, you will need to
                specify the ``state`` when constructing the :class:`Flow`.

        This is the final step in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow. This is
        called after the user consents.

        This method calls
        :meth:`requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session.fetch_token`
        and specifies the client configuration's token URI (usually Google's
        token server).

        Args:

                :meth:`requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session.fetch_token`. At least
                one of ``code`` or ``authorization_response`` must be
                specified.

        Returns:
            Mapping[str, str]: The obtained tokens. Typically, you will not use
                return value of this function and instead use
                :meth:`credentials` to obtain a
                :class:`~google.auth.credentials.Credentials` instance.

        the session's token and the client config.

        Returns:
            google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials: The constructed credentials.

        The server strategy instructs the user to open the authorization URL in
        their browser and will attempt to automatically open the URL for them.
        It will start a local web server to listen for the authorization
        response. Once authorization is complete the authorization server will
        redirect the user's browser to the local web server. The web server
        will get the authorization code from the response and shutdown. The
        code is then exchanged for a token.

        Args:
            host (str): The hostname for the local redirect server. This will
                be served over http, not https.
            bind_addr (str): Optionally provide an ip address for the redirect
                server to listen on when it is not the same as host
                (e.g. in a container). Default value is None,
                which means that the redirect server will listen
                on the ip address specified in the host parameter.
            port (int): The port for the local redirect server.
            authorization_prompt_message (str | None): The message to display to tell
                the user to navigate to the authorization URL. If None or empty,
                don't display anything.
            success_message (str): The message to display in the web browser
                the authorization flow is complete.
            open_browser (bool): Whether or not to open the authorization URL
                in the user's browser.
            redirect_uri_trailing_slash (bool): whether or not to add trailing
                slash when constructing the redirect_uri. Default value is True.
            timeout_seconds (int): It will raise an error after the timeout timing
                if there are no credentials response. The value is in seconds.
                When set to None there is no timeout.
                Default value is None.
            token_audience (str): Passed along with the request for an access
                token. Determines the endpoints with which the token can be
                used. Optional.
            browser (str): specify which browser to open for authentication. If not
                specified this defaults to default browser.
            kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed through to
                :meth:`authorization_url`.

        uOAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow

This module provides integration with `requests-oauthlib`_ for running the
`OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow`_ and acquiring user credentials.  See
`Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs`_ for an overview of OAuth 2.0
authorization scenarios Google APIs support.

Here's an example of using :class:`InstalledAppFlow`::

    from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow

    # Create the flow using the client secrets file from the Google API
    # Console.
    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
        'client_secrets.json',
        scopes=['profile', 'email'])

    flow.run_local_server()

    # You can use flow.credentials, or you can just get a requests session
    # using flow.authorized_session.
    session = flow.authorized_session()

    profile_info = session.get(
        'https://www.googleapis.com/userinfo/v2/me').json()

    print(profile_info)
    # {'name': '...',  'email': '...', ...}

    This class uses a :class:`requests_oauthlib.OAuth2Session` instance at
    :attr:`oauth2session` to perform all of the OAuth 2.0 logic. This class
    just provides convenience methods and sane defaults for doing Google's
    particular flavors of OAuth 2.0.

    Typically you'll construct an instance of this flow using
    :meth:`from_client_secrets_file` and a `client secrets file`_ obtained
    from the `Google API Console`_.

    This :class:`Flow` subclass makes it easier to perform the
    `Installed Application Authorization Flow`_. This flow is useful for
    local development or applications that are installed on a desktop operating
    system.

    This flow uses a local server strategy provided by :meth:`run_local_server`.

    Example::

        from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow

        flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
            'client_secrets.json',
            scopes=['profile', 'email'])

        flow.run_local_server()

        session = flow.authorized_session()

        profile_info = session.get(
            'https://www.googleapis.com/userinfo/v2/me').json()

        print(profile_info)
        # {'name': '...',  'email': '...', ...}


    Note that this isn't the only way to accomplish the installed
    application flow, just one of the most common. You can use the
    :class:`Flow` class to perform the same flow with different methods of
    presenting the authorization URL to the user or obtaining the authorization
    response, such as using an embedded web view.

    This function authenticates using your user credentials by going through
    the OAuth 2.0 flow. You'll open a browser window to authenticate to your
    Google account. The permissions it requests correspond to the scopes
    you've provided.

    To obtain the ``client_id`` and ``client_secret``, create an **OAuth
    client ID** with application type **Other** from the `Credentials page on
    the Google Developer's Console
    <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_. Learn more
    with the `Authenticating as an end user
    <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/end-user>`_ guide.

    Args:
        scopes (Sequence[str]):
            A list of scopes to use when authenticating to Google APIs. See
            the `list of OAuth 2.0 scopes for Google APIs
            <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes>`_.
        client_id (str):
            A string that identifies your application to Google APIs. Find
            this value in the `Credentials page on the Google Developer's
            Console
            <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_.
        client_secret (str):
            A string that verifies your application to Google APIs. Find this
            value in the `Credentials page on the Google Developer's Console
            <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials>`_.
        minimum_port (int):
            Beginning of range of ports to try for redirect URI HTTP server.
            Defaults to 8080.
        maximum_port (Optional[int]):
            End of range of ports to try (not including exactly equals ``stop``).

            )

            # 1. Open the link.
            # 2. Authorize the application to have access to your account.
            # 3. Copy and paste the authorization code to the prompt.

            # Use the credentials to construct a client for Google APIs.
            from google.cloud import bigquery

    backoff retries.

    In case a request fails due to some API rate limits,
    it will wait for some time, then retry the request.

    This can help by trying the request after some time and
    prevent the application from failing (by raising an APIError exception).

    .. Warning::
        This Client is not production ready yet.
        Use it at your own risk !

    .. note::
        To use with the `auth` module, make sure to pass this backoff
        client factory using the ``client_factory`` parameter of the
        method used.

    .. note::
        Currently known issues are:

        * will retry exponentially even when the error should
          raise instantly. Due to the Drive API that raises
          403 (Forbidden) errors for forbidden access and

    aA1_ADDR_ROW_COL_REagroupsainfuTranslates a cell's address in A1 notation to a tuple of integers.

    Same as `a1_to_rowcol()` but allows for missing row or column part
    (e.g. "A" for the first column)

    :returns: a tuple containing `row` and `column` numbers. Both indexed
        from 1 (one).
    :rtype: tuple

    Example:

    >>> _a1_to_rowcol_unbounded('A1')

    apartitionTw:utoo many values to unpack (expected 3)a_a1_to_rowcol_unboundedastartRowIndexaendRowIndexastartColumnIndexaendColumnIndexasheetIdagrid_rangeuConverts a range defined in A1 notation to a dict representing
    a `GridRange`_.

    All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open, e.g the start
    index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive: [startIndex, endIndex).

    Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side.

    .. _GridRange: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/other#GridRange

    aInvalidInputValueuinvalid value: {}, must be a column letteruConverts a column letter to its numerical index.

    This is useful when using the method :meth:`gspread.worksheet.Worksheet.col_values`.
    Which requires a column index.

    This function is case-insensitive.

    Raises :exc:`gspread.exceptions.InvalidInputValue` in case of invalid input.

    Examples::

        >>> column_letter_to_index("a")
        1

    >>> column_letter_to_index("A")

        By default values are returned as strings. See ``value_render_option``
        to change the default format.

        :param str range_name: (optional) Cell range in the A1 notation or
            a named range. If not specified the method returns values from all
            non empty cells.

        :param str major_dimension: (optional) The major dimension of the
            values. `Dimension.rows` ("ROWS") or `Dimension.cols` ("COLUMNS").
            Defaults to Dimension.rows
        :type major_dimension: :namedtuple:`~gspread.utils.Dimension`

        :param bool combine_merged_cells: (optional) If True, then all cells that
            are part of a merged cell will have the same value as the top-left
            cell of the merged cell. Defaults to False.

            .. warning::

                Setting this to True will cause an additional API request to be
                made to retrieve the values of all merged cells.


        :param str value_render_option: (optional) Determines how values should
            be rendered in the output. See `ValueRenderOption`_ in
            the Sheets API.

            Possible values are:

            ``ValueRenderOption.formatted``
                (default) Values will be calculated and formatted according
                to the cell's formatting. Formatting is based on the
                spreadsheet's locale, not the requesting user's locale.

            ``ValueRenderOption.unformatted``
                Values will be calculated, but not formatted in the reply.
                For example, if A1 is 1.23 and A2 is =A1 and formatted as
                currency, then A2 would return the number 1.23.

            ``ValueRenderOption.formula``
                Values will not be calculated. The reply will include
                the formulas. For example, if A1 is 1.23 and A2 is =A1 and
                formatted as currency, then A2 would return "=A1".

        :param str date_time_render_option: (optional) How dates, times, and
            durations should be represented in the output.

            Possible values are:

            ``DateTimeOption.serial_number``
                (default) Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields
                to be output as doubles in "serial number" format,
                as popularized by Lotus 1-2-3.

            ``DateTimeOption.formatted_string``
                Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields to be output
                as strings in their given number format
                (which depends on the spreadsheet locale).

            .. note::

                This is ignored if ``value_render_option`` is ``ValueRenderOption.formatted``.

            The default ``date_time_render_option`` is ``DateTimeOption.serial_number``.
        :type date_time_render_option: :namedtuple:`~gspread.utils.DateTimeOption`

        .. note::

            Empty trailing rows and columns will not be included.

        :param bool maintain_size: (optional) Returns a matrix of values matching the size of the requested range.

            .. warning::

                This can only work if the requested range is a complete bounded A1 notation.
                Example: ``A1:D4``: OK, ``C3:F``: Not OK, we don't know the end size of the requested range.

                This does not work with ``named_range`` either.

            Examples::

                # Works
                >>> worksheet.get("A1:B2", maintain_size=True)
                [['A1', 'B1'], ['A2', '']]

                # Does NOT maintain the requested size
                >>> worksheet.get("A1:B", maintain_size=True)
                [['A1', 'B1'], ['A2'], [], ['A4', 'B4'], ['A5']]

        Examples::

            # Return all values from the sheet
            worksheet.get_values()

            # Return all values from columns "A" and "B"
            worksheet.get_values('A:B')

            # Return values from range "A2:C10"
            worksheet.get_values('A2:C10')

            # Return values from named range "my_range"
            worksheet.get_values('my_range')

            # Return unformatted values (e.g. numbers as numbers)
            worksheet.get_values('A2:B4', value_render_option=ValueRenderOption.unformatted)

            # Return cell values without calculating formulas

    Modifies the cell formatting of an area of the provided Worksheet, using
    the provided DataFrame to determine the area to be formatted and the formats
    to be used.

    :param worksheet: the gspread worksheet to set with content of DataFrame.
    :param dataframe: the DataFrame.
    :param formatter: an optional instance of ``DataFrameFormatter`` class, which
                      will examine the contents of the DataFrame and
                      assemble a set of ``gspread_formatter`` operations
                      to be performed after the DataFrame contents
                      are written to the given Worksheet. The formatting
                      operations are performed after the contents are written
                      and before this function returns. Defaults to
                      ``DEFAULT_FORMATTER``.
    :param row: number of row at which to begin formatting. Defaults to 1.
    :param col: number of column at which to begin formatting. Defaults to 1.
    :param include_index: if True, include the DataFrame's index as an
            additional column when performing formatting. Defaults to False.
    :param include_column_header: if True, format a header row before data.
            Defaults to True.

    integers are exactly those x such that start_i <= x < end_i for some i.

Given a list of integers, made up of (hopefully) a small number of long runs
of consecutive integers, compute a representation of the form
((start1, end1), (start2, end2) ...). Then answer the question "was x present
in the original list?" in time O(log(# runs)).

    aSystemRandomuuGenerates a non-guessable OAuth token

    OAuth (1 and 2) does not specify the format of tokens except that they
    should be strings of random characters. Tokens should not be guessable
    and entropy when generating the random characters is important. Which is
    why SystemRandom is used instead of the default random.choice method.

        Signs an HTTP request with the specified parts.

        Returns a 3-tuple of the signed request's URI, headers, and body.
        Note that http_method is not returned as it is unaffected by the OAuth
        signing process. Also worth noting is that duplicate parameters
        will be included in the signature, regardless of where they are
        specified (query, body).

        The body argument may be a dict, a list of 2-tuples, or a formencoded
        string. The Content-Type header must be 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        if it is present.

        If the body argument is not one of the above, it will be returned
        verbatim as it is unaffected by the OAuth signing process. Attempting to
        sign a request with non-formencoded data using the OAuth body signature
        type is invalid and will raise an exception.

        If the body does contain parameters, it will be returned as a properly-
        formatted formencoded string.

        Body may not be included if the http_method is either GET or HEAD as
        this changes the semantic meaning of the request.

        All string data MUST be unicode or be encoded with the same encoding
        scheme supplied to the Client constructor, default utf-8. This includes
        strings inside body dicts, for example.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is an implementation of various logic needed
for signing and checking OAuth 1.0 RFC 5849 requests.

It supports all three standard signature methods defined in RFC 5849:

- HMAC-SHA1
- RSA-SHA1
- PLAINTEXT

It also supports signature methods that are not defined in RFC 5849. These are
based on the standard ones but replace SHA-1 with the more secure SHA-256:

- HMAC-SHA256
- RSA-SHA256

    has all information necessary (body, status, headers) to quickly form
    and return a proper response. See :doc:`/oauth1/validator` for details on which

        If the callback URI tied to the current token is "oob", a response with
        a 200 status code will be returned. In this case, it may be desirable to
        modify the response to better display the verifier to the client.

    to their protected resources to a client.

    Typical use would be to have two views, one for displaying the authorization
    form and one to process said form on submission.

    The first view will want to utilize ``get_realms_and_credentials`` to fetch
    requested realms and useful client credentials, such as name and
    description, to be used when creating the authorization form.

    During form processing you can use ``create_authorization_response`` to
    validate the request, create a verifier as well as prepare the final
    redirection URI used to send the user back to the client.

This module is an implementation of the request token provider logic of
OAuth 1.0 RFC 5849. It validates the correctness of request token requests,
creates and persists tokens as well as create the proper response to be

        Taget_redirect_uriuGet the redirect URI associated with a request token.

        :param token: The request token string.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: The redirect URI associated with the request token.

        It may be desirable to return a custom URI if the redirect is set to "oob".
        In this case, the user will be redirected to the returned URI and at that
        endpoint the verifier can be displayed.

        This method is used by

        * AuthorizationEndpoint
        Taget_rsa_keyuRetrieves a previously stored client provided RSA key.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: The rsa public key as a string.

        This method must allow the use of a dummy client_key value. Fetching
        the rsa key using the dummy key must take the same amount of time
        as fetching a key for a valid client. The dummy key must also be of
        the same bit length as client keys.

        Note that the key must be returned in plaintext.

        This method is used by

        * AccessTokenEndpoint
        * RequestTokenEndpoint
        * ResourceEndpoint
        * SignatureOnlyEndpoint
        Tainvalidate_request_tokenuInvalidates a used request token.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.

        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Per `Section 2.3`_ of the spec:

        "The server MUST (...) ensure that the temporary
        credentials have not expired or been used before."

        .. _`Section 2.3`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-2.3

        This method should ensure that provided token won't validate anymore.
        It can be simply removing RequestToken from storage or setting
        specific flag that makes it invalid (note that such flag should be
        also validated during request token validation).

        This method is used by

        * AccessTokenEndpoint
        Tavalidate_client_keyuValidates that supplied client key is a registered and valid client.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        Note that if the dummy client is supplied it should validate in same
        or nearly the same amount of time as a valid one.

        Ensure latency inducing tasks are mimiced even for dummy clients.
        For example, use::

            from your_datastore import Client
            try:
                return Client.exists(client_key, access_token)
            except DoesNotExist:
                return False

        Rather than::

            from your_datastore import Client
            if access_token == self.dummy_access_token:
                return False
            else:
                return Client.exists(client_key, access_token)

        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        Per `Section 3.3`_ of the spec.

        "A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow
        the server to verify that a request has never been made before and
        helps prevent replay attacks when requests are made over a non-secure
        channel.  The nonce value MUST be unique across all requests with the
        same timestamp, client credentials, and token combinations."

        .. _`Section 3.3`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.3

        One of the first validation checks that will be made is for the validity
        of the nonce and timestamp, which are associated with a client key and
        possibly a token. If invalid then immediately fail the request
        by returning False. If the nonce/timestamp pair has been used before and
        you may just have detected a replay attack. Therefore it is an essential
        part of OAuth security that you not allow nonce/timestamp reuse.
        Note that this validation check is done before checking the validity of
        the client and token.::

           nonces_and_timestamps_database = [
              (u'foo', 1234567890, u'rannoMstrInghere', u'bar')

                       not in self.nonces_and_timestamps_database)

        Tavalidate_redirect_uriuValidates the client supplied redirection URI.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.
        :param redirect_uri: The URI the client which to redirect back to after
                             authorization is successful.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        It is highly recommended that OAuth providers require their clients
        to register all redirection URIs prior to using them in requests and
        register them as absolute URIs. See `CWE-601`_ for more information
        about open redirection attacks.

        By requiring registration of all redirection URIs it should be
        straightforward for the provider to verify whether the supplied
        redirect_uri is valid or not.

        Alternatively per `Section 2.1`_ of the spec:

        "If the client is unable to receive callbacks or a callback URI has
        been established via other means, the parameter value MUST be set to
        "oob" (case sensitive), to indicate an out-of-band configuration."

        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        This method is invoked when obtaining a request token and should
        tie a realm to the request token and after user authorization
        this realm restriction should transfer to the access token.

        This method is used by

        * RequestTokenEndpoint
        Tavalidate_realmsuValidates access to the request realm.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.
        :param token: A request token string.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :param uri: The URI the realms is protecting.
        :param realms: A list of realms that must have been granted to
                       the access token.
        :returns: True or False

        How providers choose to use the realm parameter is outside the OAuth
        specification but it is commonly used to restrict access to a subset
        of protected resources such as "photos".

        realms is a convenience parameter which can be used to provide
        a per view method pre-defined list of allowed realms.

        Can be as simple as::

            from your_datastore import RequestToken
            request_token = RequestToken.get(token, None)

            if not request_token:
                return False
            return set(request_token.realms).issuperset(set(realms))

        This method is used by

        * ResourceEndpoint
        Tavalidate_verifieruValidates a verification code.

        :param client_key: The client/consumer key.
        :param token: A request token string.
        :param verifier: The authorization verifier string.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        OAuth providers issue a verification code to clients after the
        resource owner authorizes access. This code is used by the client to
        obtain token credentials and the provider must verify that the
        verifier is valid and associated with the client as well as the
        resource owner.

        Verifier validation should be done in near constant time
        (to avoid verifier enumeration). To achieve this we need a
        constant time string comparison which is provided by OAuthLib
        in ``oauthlib.common.safe_string_equals``::

            from your_datastore import Verifier
            correct_verifier = Verifier.get(client_key, request_token)
            from oauthlib.common import safe_string_equals
            return safe_string_equals(verifier, correct_verifier)

        This method is used by

        * AccessTokenEndpoint
        Taverify_request_tokenuVerify that the given OAuth1 request token is valid.

        :param token: A request token string.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        This method is used only in AuthorizationEndpoint to check whether the
        oauth_token given in the authorization URL is valid or not.
        This request is not signed and thus similar ``validate_request_token``
        method can not be used.

        This method is used by

        * AuthorizationEndpoint
        Taverify_realmsuVerify authorized realms to see if they match those given to token.

        :param token: An access token string.
        :param realms: A list of realms the client attempts to access.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :returns: True or False

        This prevents the list of authorized realms sent by the client during
        the authorization step to be altered to include realms outside what
        was bound with the request token.

        Can be as simple as::

            valid_realms = self.get_realms(token)
            return all((r in valid_realms for r in realms))

        This method is used by

        * AuthorizationEndpoint

        :param token: A dict with token credentials.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        The token dictionary will at minimum include

        * ``oauth_token`` the access token string.
        * ``oauth_token_secret`` the token specific secret used in signing.
        * ``oauth_authorized_realms`` a space separated list of realms.

        Client key can be obtained from ``request.client_key``.

        The list of realms (not joined string) can be obtained from
        ``request.realm``.

        This method is used by

        * AccessTokenEndpoint
        Tasave_request_tokenuSave an OAuth1 request token.

        :param token: A dict with token credentials.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        The token dictionary will at minimum include

        * ``oauth_token`` the request token string.
        * ``oauth_token_secret`` the token specific secret used in signing.
        * ``oauth_callback_confirmed`` the string ``true``.

        Client key can be obtained from ``request.client_key``.

        This method is used by

        * RequestTokenEndpoint
        Tasave_verifieruAssociate an authorization verifier with a request token.

        :param token: A request token string.
        :param verifier: A dictionary containing the oauth_verifier and
                        oauth_token
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        We need to associate verifiers with tokens for validation during the
        access token request.

        Note that unlike save_x_token token here is the ``oauth_token`` token
        string from the request token saved previously.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is an implementation of various logic needed
for signing and checking OAuth 1.0 RFC 5849 requests.
a__doc__a__file__a__spec__aoriginahas_locationa__cached__uTaSIGNATURE_METHODSautilslluoauthlib.oauth1.rfc5849.request_validatora__module__uA validator/datastore interaction base class for OAuth 1 providers.

    OAuth providers should inherit from RequestValidator and implement the
    methods and properties outlined below. Further details are provided in the
    documentation for each method and property.

    Methods used to check the format of input parameters. Common tests include
    length, character set, membership, range or pattern. These tests are
    referred to as `whitelisting or blacklisting`_. Whitelisting is better
    but blacklisting can be useful to spot malicious activity.
    The following have methods a default implementation:

    - check_client_key
    - check_request_token
    - check_access_token
    - check_nonce
    - check_verifier
    - check_realms

    The methods above default to whitelist input parameters, checking that they
    are alphanumerical and between a minimum and maximum length. Rather than
    overloading the methods a few properties can be used to configure these
    methods.

    * @safe_characters -> (character set)
    * @client_key_length -> (min, max)
    * @request_token_length -> (min, max)
    * @access_token_length -> (min, max)
    * @nonce_length -> (min, max)
    * @verifier_length -> (min, max)
    * @realms -> [list, of, realms]

    Methods used to validate/invalidate input parameters. These checks usually
    hit either persistent or temporary storage such as databases or the
    filesystem. See each methods documentation for detailed usage.
    The following methods must be implemented:

    - validate_client_key
    - validate_request_token
    - validate_access_token
    - validate_timestamp_and_nonce
    - validate_redirect_uri
    - validate_requested_realms
    - validate_realms
    - validate_verifier
    - invalidate_request_token

    Methods used to retrieve sensitive information from storage.
    The following methods must be implemented:

    - get_client_secret
    - get_request_token_secret
    - get_access_token_secret
    - get_rsa_key
    - get_realms
    - get_default_realms
    - get_redirect_uri

    Methods used to save credentials.
    The following methods must be implemented:

    - save_request_token
    - save_verifier
    - save_access_token

    Methods used to verify input parameters. This methods are used during
    authorizing request token by user (AuthorizationEndpoint), to check if
    parameters are valid. During token authorization request is not signed,
    thus 'validation' methods can not be used. The following methods must be
    implemented:

    - verify_realms
    - verify_request_token

    To prevent timing attacks it is necessary to not exit early even if the
    client key or resource owner key is invalid. Instead dummy values should
    be used during the remaining verification process. It is very important
    that the dummy client and token are valid input parameters to the methods
    get_client_secret, get_rsa_key and get_(access/request)_token_secret and
    that the running time of those methods when given a dummy value remain
    equivalent to the running time when given a valid client/resource owner.
    The following properties must be implemented:

    * @dummy_client
    * @dummy_request_token
    * @dummy_access_token

    Example implementations have been provided, note that the database used is
    a simple dictionary and serves only an illustrative purpose. Use whichever
    database suits your project and how to access it is entirely up to you.
    The methods are introduced in an order which should make understanding
    their use more straightforward and as such it could be worth reading what
    follows in chronological order.

    Construct the signature base string.

    The *signature base string* is the value that is calculated and signed by
    the client. It is also independently calculated by the server to verify
    the signature, and therefore must produce the exact same value at both
    ends or the signature won't verify.

    The rules for calculating the *signature base string* are defined in
    section 3.4.1.1`_ of RFC 5849.

    Calculates the _base string URI_.

    The *base string URI* is one of the components that make up the
     *signature base string*.

    The ``host`` is optional. If provided, it is used to override any host and
    port values in the ``uri``. The value for ``host`` is usually extracted from
    the "Host" request header from the HTTP request. Its value may be just the
    hostname, or the hostname followed by a colon and a TCP/IP port number
    (hostname:port). If a value for the``host`` is provided but it does not
    contain a port number, the default port number is used (i.e. if the ``uri``
    contained a port number, it will be discarded).

This module is an implementation of `section 3.4`_ of RFC 5849.

**Usage**

Steps for signing a request:

1. Collect parameters from the request using ``collect_parameters``.
2. Normalize those parameters using ``normalize_parameters``.
3. Create the *base string URI* using ``base_string_uri``.
4. Create the *signature base string* from the above three components
   using ``signature_base_string``.
5. Pass the *signature base string* and the client credentials to one of the
   sign-with-client functions. The HMAC-based signing functions needs
   client credentials with secrets. The RSA-based signing functions needs
   client credentials with an RSA private key.

To verify a request, pass the request and credentials to one of the verify
functions. The HMAC-based signing functions needs the shared secrets. The
RSA-based verify functions needs the RSA public key.

**Scope**

All of the functions in this module should be considered internal to OAuthLib,
since they are not imported into the "oauthlib.oauth1" module. Programs using
OAuthLib should not use directly invoke any of the functions in this module.

**Deprecated functions**

The "sign_" methods that are not "_with_client" have been deprecated. They may
be removed in a future release. Since they are all internal functions, this
should have no impact on properly behaving programs.

    The client can request an access token using only its client
    credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
    client is requesting access to the protected resources under its
    control, or those of another resource owner which has been previously
    arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond
    the scope of this specification).

    The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential
    clients.

    Since the client authentication is used as the authorization grant,
    no additional authorization request is needed.

        registration.

        :param default_token_placement: Tokens can be supplied in the Authorization
        header (default), the URL query component (``query``) or the request
        body (``body``).

        :param token_type: OAuth 2 token type. Defaults to Bearer. Change this
        if you specify the ``access_token`` parameter and know it is of a
        different token type, such as a MAC, JWT or SAML token. Can
        also be supplied as ``token_type`` inside the ``token`` dict parameter.

        :param access_token: An access token (string) used to authenticate
        requests to protected resources. Can also be supplied inside the
        ``token`` dict parameter.

        tokens. Can also be supplied inside the ``token`` dict parameter.

        :param mac_key: Encryption key used with MAC tokens.

        :param mac_algorithm:  Hashing algorithm for MAC tokens.

        The access token type provides the client with the information
        required to successfully utilize the access token to make a protected
        resource request (along with type-specific attributes).  The client
        MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token
        type.

        For example, the "bearer" token type defined in
        [`I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer`_] is utilized by simply including the access
        token string in the request:

        .. code-block:: http

            GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com
            Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

        while the "mac" token type defined in [`I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac`_] is
        utilized by issuing a MAC key together with the access token which is
        used to sign certain components of the HTTP requests:

        .. code-block:: http

            GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com
            Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
                                nonce="274312:dj83hs9s",

        aprepare_request_uriaredirect_uriaFORM_ENC_HEADERSuuPrepare the authorization request.

        This is the first step in many OAuth flows in which the user is
        redirected to a certain authorization URL. This method adds
        required parameters to the authorization URL.

        :param authorization_url: Provider authorization endpoint URL.
        :param state: CSRF protection string. Will be automatically created if
            not provided. The generated state is available via the ``state``
            attribute. Clients should verify that the state is unchanged and
            present in the authorization response. This verification is done
            automatically if using the ``authorization_response`` parameter
            with ``prepare_token_request``.
        :param redirect_url: Redirect URL to which the user will be returned
            after authorization. Must be provided unless previously setup with
            the provider. If provided then it must also be provided in the
            token request.
        :param scope: List of scopes to request. Must be equal to
            or a subset of the scopes granted when obtaining the refresh
            token. If none is provided, the ones provided in the constructor are
            used.
        :param kwargs: Additional parameters to included in the request.
        :returns: The prepared request tuple with (url, headers, body).
        aparse_request_uri_responseTastateaprepare_request_bodyabodyuPrepare a token creation request.

        Note that these requests usually require client authentication, either
        by including client_id or a set of provider specific authentication
        credentials.

        :param token_url: Provider token creation endpoint URL.
        :param authorization_response: The full redirection URL string, i.e.
            the location to which the user was redirected after successful
            authorization. Used to mine credentials needed to obtain a token
            in this step, such as authorization code.
        :param redirect_url: The redirect_url supplied with the authorization
            request (if there was one).
        :param state:
        :param body: Existing request body (URL encoded string) to embed parameters
                     into. This may contain extra parameters. Default ''.
        :param kwargs: Additional parameters to included in the request.
        :returns: The prepared request tuple with (url, headers, body).
        aprepare_refresh_bodyuPrepare an access token refresh request.

        Expired access tokens can be replaced by new access tokens without
        going through the OAuth dance if the client obtained a refresh token.
        This refresh token and authentication credentials can be used to
        obtain a new access token, and possibly a new refresh token.

        :param token_url: Provider token refresh endpoint URL.
        :param refresh_token: Refresh token string.
        :param body: Existing request body (URL encoded string) to embed parameters
            into. This may contain extra parameters. Default ''.
        :param scope: List of scopes to request. Must be equal to
            or a subset of the scopes granted when obtaining the refresh
            token. If none is provided, the ones provided in the constructor are
            used.
        :param kwargs: Additional parameters to included in the request.
        :returns: The prepared request tuple with (url, headers, body).
        aprepare_token_revocation_requestatoken_type_hintacallbackuPrepare a token revocation request.

        :param revocation_url: Provider token revocation endpoint URL.
        :param token: The access or refresh token to be revoked (string).
        :param token_type_hint: ``"access_token"`` (default) or
            ``"refresh_token"``. This is optional and if you wish to not pass it you
            must provide ``token_type_hint=None``.
        :param body:
        :param callback: A jsonp callback such as ``package.callback`` to be invoked
            upon receiving the response. Not that it should not include a () suffix.
        :param kwargs: Additional parameters to included in the request.
        :returns: The prepared request tuple with (url, headers, body).

        Note that JSONP request may use GET requests as the parameters will
        be added to the request URL query as opposed to the request body.

        aparse_token_responseTascopeuParse the JSON response body.

        If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
        authorization server issues an access token as described in
        `Section 5.1`_.  A refresh token SHOULD NOT be included.  If the request
        failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
        returns an error response as described in `Section 5.2`_.

        :param body: The response body from the token request.
        :param scope: Scopes originally requested. If none is provided, the ones
            provided in the constructor are used.
        :return: Dictionary of token parameters.
        :raises: Warning if scope has changed. :py:class:`oauthlib.oauth2.errors.OAuth2Error`
            if response is invalid.

        These response are json encoded and could easily be parsed without
        the assistance of OAuthLib. However, there are a few subtle issues
        to be aware of regarding the response which are helpfully addressed
        through the raising of various errors.

        A successful response should always contain

        **access_token**
                The access token issued by the authorization server. Often
                a random string.

        **token_type**
            The type of the token issued as described in `Section 7.1`_.
            Commonly ``Bearer``.

        While it is not mandated it is recommended that the provider include

        **expires_in**
            The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
            example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
            expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.

         **scope**
            Providers may supply this in all responses but are required to only
            if it has changed since the authorization request.

        If the authorization server issued a refresh token to the client, the
        client makes a refresh request to the token endpoint by adding the
        following parameters using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
        format in the HTTP request entity-body:

        :param refresh_token: REQUIRED.  The refresh token issued to the client.
        :param scope:  OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
            Section 3.3.  The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope
            not originally granted by the resource owner, and if omitted is
            treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the
            resource owner. Note that if none is provided, the ones provided
            in the constructor are used if any.

        :param length: REQUIRED. The length of the code_verifier.

        The client first creates a code verifier, "code_verifier", for each
        OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] Authorization Request, in the following manner:

        .. code-block:: text

               code_verifier = high-entropy cryptographic random STRING using the
               unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
               from Section 2.3 of [RFC3986], with a minimum length of 43 characters
               and a maximum length of 128 characters.

        :param code_verifier: REQUIRED. The **code_verifier** generated from `create_code_verifier()`.
        :param code_challenge_method: OPTIONAL. The method used to derive the **code_challenge**. Acceptable values include `S256`. DEFAULT is `plain`.

               The client then creates a code challenge derived from the code
               verifier by using one of the following transformations on the code
               verifier::

                   plain
                      code_challenge = code_verifier
                   S256
                      code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))

               If the client is capable of using `S256`, it MUST use `S256`, as
               `S256` is Mandatory To Implement (MTI) on the server.  Clients are
               permitted to use `plain` only if they cannot support `S256` for some
               technical reason and know via out-of-band configuration that the
               server supports `plain`.

               The plain transformation is for compatibility with existing
               deployments and for constrained environments that can't use the S256 transformation.

    This class also acts as a generic interface providing methods common to all
    client types such as ``prepare_authorization_request`` and
    ``prepare_token_revocation_request``. The ``prepare_x_request`` methods are
    the recommended way of interacting with clients (as opposed to the abstract
    prepare uri/body/etc methods). They are recommended over the older set
    because they are easier to use (more consistent) and add a few additional
    security checks, such as HTTPS and state checking.

    Some of these methods require further implementation only provided by the
    specific purpose clients such as
    :py:class:`oauthlib.oauth2.MobileApplicationClient` and thus you should always
    seek to use the client class matching the OAuth workflow you need. For
    Python, this is usually :py:class:`oauthlib.oauth2.WebApplicationClient`.

    The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
    cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
    client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged
    application.  The authorization server should take special care when
    enabling this grant type, and only allow it when other flows are not
    viable.

    The grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
    resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
    an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients
    using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
    authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
    access token.

    The method through which the client obtains the resource owner
    credentials is beyond the scope of this specification.  The client
    MUST discard the credentials once an access token has been obtained.

        using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per `Appendix B`_:

        :param redirect_uri:  OPTIONAL. The redirect URI must be an absolute URI
                              and it should have been registered with the OAuth
                              provider prior to use. As described in `Section 3.1.2`_.

        :param state:   RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
                        state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                        server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
                        to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing

        In addition to supplied parameters, OAuthLib will append the ``client_id``
        that was provided in the constructor as well as the mandatory ``response_type``

        If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
        server issues an access token and delivers it to the client by adding
        the following parameters to the fragment component of the redirection
        URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

        :param uri: The callback URI that resulted from the user being redirected
                    back from the provider to you, the client.
        :param state: The state provided in the authorization request.
        :param scope: The scopes provided in the authorization request.
        :return: Dictionary of token parameters.
        :raises: OAuth2Error if response is invalid.

        A successful response should always contain

        **access_token**
                The access token issued by the authorization server. Often
                a random string.

        **token_type**
            The type of the token issued as described in `Section 7.1`_.
            Commonly ``Bearer``.

        **state**
            If you provided the state parameter in the authorization phase, then
            the provider is required to include that exact state value in the
            response.

        While it is not mandated it is recommended that the provider include

        **expires_in**
            The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
            example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
            expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.

        **scope**
            Providers may supply this in all responses but are required to only
            if it has changed since the authorization request.

        A few example responses can be seen below::

    A user-agent-based application is a public client in which the
    client code is downloaded from a web server and executes within a
    user-agent (e.g. web browser) on the device used by the resource
    owner.  Protocol data and credentials are easily accessible (and
    often visible) to the resource owner.  Since such applications
    reside within the user-agent, they can make seamless use of the
    user-agent capabilities when requesting authorization.

    The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not
    support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public
    clients known to operate a particular redirection URI.  These clients
    are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language
    such as JavaScript.

    As a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
    interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
    browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
    from the authorization server.

    Unlike the authorization code grant type in which the client makes
    separate requests for authorization and access token, the client
    receives the access token as the result of the authorization request.

    The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and
    relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of
    the redirection URI.  Because the access token is encoded into the
    redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other
    applications residing on the same device.

                                  if the client is not authenticating with the

        :param kwargs: Extra credentials to include in the token request.

        Parameters marked with a `*` above are not explicit arguments in the
        function signature, but are specially documented arguments for items
        appearing in the generic `**kwargs` keyworded input.

        The "scope" parameter may be used, as defined in the Assertion
        Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants
        [I-D.ietf-oauth-assertions] specification, to indicate the requested
        scope.

        Authentication of the client is optional, as described in
        `Section 3.2.1`_ of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and consequently, the
        "client_id" is only needed when a form of client authentication that
        relies on the parameter is used.

        The following non-normative example demonstrates an Access Token
        Request with a JWT as an authorization grant (with extra line breaks
        for display purposes only):

    JWT bearer tokes can be used to request an access token when a client
    wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship, expressed through the
    semantics of (and digital signature or keyed message digest calculated
    over) the JWT, without a direct user approval step at the authorization
    server.

    This grant type does not involve an authorization step. It may be
    used by both public and confidential clients.

        The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
        parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
        using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per `Appendix B`_:

        :param redirect_uri:  OPTIONAL. The redirect URI must be an absolute URI
                              and it should have been registered with the OAuth
                              provider prior to use. As described in `Section 3.1.2`_.

        :param scope:  OPTIONAL. The scope of the access request as described by
                       Section 3.3`_. These may be any string but are commonly
                       URIs or various categories such as ``videos`` or ``documents``.

        :param state:   RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
                        state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                        server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
                        to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
                        cross-site request forgery as described in `Section 10.12`_.

        :param code_challenge: OPTIONAL. PKCE parameter. REQUIRED if PKCE is enforced.
                        A challenge derived from the code_verifier that is sent in the
                        authorization request, to be verified against later.

        :param code_challenge_method: OPTIONAL. PKCE parameter. A method that was used to derive code challenge.
                                      Defaults to "plain" if not present in the request.

        :param kwargs:  Extra arguments to include in the request URI.

        In addition to supplied parameters, OAuthLib will append the ``client_id``
        that was provided in the constructor as well as the mandatory ``response_type``
        argument, set to ``code``::

            >>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import WebApplicationClient

        The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
        following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        format in the HTTP request entity-body:

        :param code:    REQUIRED. The authorization code received from the
                        authorization server.

        :param redirect_uri:    REQUIRED, if the "redirect_uri" parameter was included in the
                                authorization request as described in `Section 4.1.1`_, and their
                                values MUST be identical.

        :param body: Existing request body (URL encoded string) to embed parameters
                     into. This may contain extra parameters. Default ''.

        :param include_client_id: `True` (default) to send the `client_id` in the
                                  body of the upstream request. This is required
                                  if the client is not authenticating with the
                                  authorization server as described in `Section 3.2.1`_.
        :type include_client_id: Boolean

        :param code_verifier: OPTIONAL. A cryptographically random string that is used to correlate the
                                        authorization request to the token request.

        :param kwargs: Extra parameters to include in the token request.

        In addition OAuthLib will add the ``grant_type`` parameter set to
        ``authorization_code``.

        If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client
        credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
        client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
        in `Section 3.2.1`_::

            >>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import WebApplicationClient
            >>> client = WebApplicationClient('your_id')
            >>> client.prepare_request_body(code='sh35ksdf09sf')
            'grant_type=authorization_code&code=sh35ksdf09sf'
            >>> client.prepare_request_body(code_verifier='KB46DCKJ873NCGXK5GD682NHDKK34GR')
            'grant_type=authorization_code&code_verifier=KB46DCKJ873NCGXK5GD682NHDKK34GR'
            >>> client.prepare_request_body(code='sh35ksdf09sf', foo='bar')
            'grant_type=authorization_code&code=sh35ksdf09sf&foo=bar'

        `Section 3.2.1` also states:
            In the "authorization_code" "grant_type" request to the token
            endpoint, an unauthenticated client MUST send its "client_id" to
            prevent itself from inadvertently accepting a code intended for a
            client with a different "client_id".  This protects the client from
            substitution of the authentication code.  (It provides no additional
            security for the protected resource.)

        aparse_authorization_code_responseTastateapopulate_code_attributesuParse the URI query for code and state.

        If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
        server issues an authorization code and delivers it to the client by
        adding the following parameters to the query component of the
        redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

        :param uri: The callback URI that resulted from the user being redirected
                    back from the provider to you, the client.
        :param state: The state provided in the authorization request.

        **code**
            The authorization code generated by the authorization server.
            The authorization code MUST expire shortly after it is issued
            to mitigate the risk of leaks. A maximum authorization code
            lifetime of 10 minutes is RECOMMENDED. The client MUST NOT
            use the authorization code more than once. If an authorization
            code is used more than once, the authorization server MUST deny
            the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens
            previously issued based on that authorization code.
            The authorization code is bound to the client identifier and
            redirection URI.

        **state**
                If the "state" parameter was present in the authorization request.

        This method is mainly intended to enforce strict state checking with
        the added benefit of easily extracting parameters from the URI::

            >>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import WebApplicationClient
            >>> client = WebApplicationClient('your_id')
            >>> uri = 'https://example.com/callback?code=sdfkjh345&state=sfetw45'
            >>> client.parse_request_uri_response(uri, state='sfetw45')
            {'state': 'sfetw45', 'code': 'sdfkjh345'}

    from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.

    The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the resource
    owner and obtain an authorization grant.  The authorization server
    MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner.  The way in
    which the authorization server authenticates the resource owner (e.g.
    username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of
    this specification.

    The endpoint URI MAY include an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    formatted (per `Appendix B`_) query component,
    which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.  The
    endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component::

        https://example.com/path?query=component             # OK
        https://example.com/path?query=component#fragment    # Not OK

    Since requests to the authorization endpoint result in user
    authentication and the transmission of clear-text credentials (in the
    HTTP response), the authorization server MUST require the use of TLS
    as described in Section 1.6 when sending requests to the
    authorization endpoint::

        # We will deny any request which URI schema is not with https

    The authorization server MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET"
    method [RFC2616] for the authorization endpoint, and MAY support the
    use of the "POST" method as well::

        # HTTP method is currently not enforced

    Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were
    omitted from the request.  The authorization server MUST ignore
    unrecognized request parameters.  Request and response parameters
    MUST NOT be included more than once::

        # Enforced through the design of oauthlib.common.Request

        If the authorization server is unable to determine the state
        of the token without additional information, it SHOULD return
        an introspection response indicating the token is not active

        help the authorization server optimize the token lookup.  If the
        server is unable to locate the token using the given hint, it MUST
        extend its search across all of its supported token types.  An
        authorization server MAY ignore this parameter, particularly if it

        The introspection endpoint MAY accept other OPTIONAL
        parameters to provide further context to the query.  For
        instance, an authorization server may desire to know the IP
        address of the client accessing the protected resource to
        determine if the correct client is likely to be presenting the
        token.  The definition of this or any other parameters are

   This endpoint defines a method to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization
   server to determine the active state of an OAuth 2.0 token and to
   determine meta-information about this token. OAuth 2.0 deployments
   can use this method to convey information about the authorization
   context of the token from the authorization server to the protected
   resource.

   To prevent the values of access tokens from leaking into
   server-side logs via query parameters, an authorization server
   offering token introspection MAY disallow the use of HTTP GET on
   the introspection endpoint and instead require the HTTP POST method
   to be used at the introspection endpoint.

        Authorization servers can have metadata describing their
        configuration.  The following authorization server metadata values
        are used by this specification. More details can be found in
        `RFC8414 section 2`_ :

       issuer
          REQUIRED

       authorization_endpoint
          URL of the authorization server's authorization endpoint
          [`RFC6749#Authorization`_].  This is REQUIRED unless no grant types are supported
          that use the authorization endpoint.

       token_endpoint
          URL of the authorization server's token endpoint [`RFC6749#Token`_].  This
          is REQUIRED unless only the implicit grant type is supported.

       scopes_supported
          RECOMMENDED.

       response_types_supported
          REQUIRED.

       Other OPTIONAL fields:

       grant_types_supported
          OPTIONAL.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0 grant
          type values that this authorization server supports.  The array
          values used are the same as those used with the "grant_types"
          parameter defined by "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration
          Protocol" [`RFC7591`_].  If omitted, the default value is
          "["authorization_code", "implicit"]".

    covers the requested resource.  The methods used by the resource
    server to validate the access token (as well as any error responses)
    are beyond the scope of this specification but generally involve an
    interaction or coordination between the resource server and the
    authorization server::

        # For most cases, returning a 403 should suffice.

    The method in which the client utilizes the access token to
    authenticate with the resource server depends on the type of access
    token issued by the authorization server.  Typically, it involves
    using the HTTP "Authorization" request header field [RFC2617] with an
    authentication scheme defined by the specification of the access
    token type used, such as [RFC6750]::

        # Access tokens may also be provided in query and body
        https://example.com/protected?access_token=kjfch2345sdf   # Query
        access_token=sdf23409df   # Body

        The authorization server responds with HTTP status code 200 if the
        token has been revoked successfully or if the client submitted an
        invalid token.

        Note: invalid tokens do not cause an error response since the client
        cannot handle such an error in a reasonable way.  Moreover, the purpose
        of the revocation request, invalidating the particular token, is
        already achieved.

        The content of the response body is ignored by the client as all
        necessary information is conveyed in the response code.

        An invalid token type hint value is ignored by the authorization server
        and does not influence the revocation response.

        The client constructs the request by including the following parameters
        using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format in the HTTP
        request entity-body:

        token (REQUIRED).  The token that the client wants to get revoked.

        token_type_hint (OPTIONAL).  A hint about the type of the token
        submitted for revocation.  Clients MAY pass this parameter in order to
        help the authorization server to optimize the token lookup.  If the
        server is unable to locate the token using the given hint, it MUST
        extend its search across all of its supported token types.  An
        authorization server MAY ignore this parameter, particularly if it is
        able to detect the token type automatically.  This specification
        defines two such values:

                *  access_token: An Access Token as defined in [RFC6749],
                    `section 1.4`_

                *  refresh_token: A Refresh Token as defined in [RFC6749],
                    `section 1.5`_

                Specific implementations, profiles, and extensions of this
                specification MAY define other values for this parameter using
                the registry defined in `Section 4.1.2`_.

        The client also includes its authentication credentials as described in
        `Section 2.3`_. of [`RFC6749`_].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is an implementation of various logic needed
for consuming and providing OAuth 2.0 RFC6749.
a__doc__a__file__a__spec__aoriginahas_locationa__cached__aloggingluoauthlib.commonTaRequestuoauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749TautilsabaseTaBaseEndpointacatch_errors_and_unavailabilitylacatch_errors_and_unavailabilityagetLoggerTuoauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.endpoints.tokena__prepare__aTokenEndpointa__getitem__u%s.__prepare__() must return a mapping, not %sa__name__u<metaclass>uoauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.endpoints.tokena__module__uToken issuing endpoint.

    The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by
    presenting its authorization grant or refresh token.  The token
    endpoint is used with every authorization grant except for the
    implicit grant type (since an access token is issued directly).

    The means through which the client obtains the location of the token
    endpoint are beyond the scope of this specification, but the location
    is typically provided in the service documentation.

    The endpoint URI MAY include an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    formatted (per `Appendix B`_) query component,
    which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.  The
    endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component::

        https://example.com/path?query=component             # OK
        https://example.com/path?query=component#fragment    # Not OK

    Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of
    clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and response), the
    authorization server MUST require the use of TLS as described in
    Section 1.6 when sending requests to the token endpoint::

        # We will deny any request which URI schema is not with https

    The client MUST use the HTTP "POST" method when making access token
    requests::

        # HTTP method is currently not enforced

    Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were
    omitted from the request.  The authorization server MUST ignore
    unrecognized request parameters.  Request and response parameters
    MUST NOT be included more than once::

        # Delegated to each grant type.

    Errors during authorization where user should not be redirected back.

    If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching
    redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,
    the authorization server SHOULD inform the resource owner of the
    error and MUST NOT automatically redirect the user-agent to the
    invalid redirection URI.

    Instead the user should be informed of the error by the provider itself.
    aInvalidRequestFatalErroru
    For fatal errors, the request is missing a required parameter, includes
    an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is
    otherwise malformed.

    otherwise malformed.
    aMissingResponseTypeErroruMissing response_type parameter.aMissingCodeChallengeErroru
    If the server requires Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) by OAuth
    public clients and the client does not send the "code_challenge" in
    the request, the authorization endpoint MUST return the authorization
    error response with the "error" value set to "invalid_request".  The
    "error_description" or the response of "error_uri" SHOULD explain the
    nature of error, e.g., code challenge required.
    uCode challenge required.aMissingCodeVerifierErroru
    The request to the token endpoint, when PKCE is enabled, has
    the parameter `code_verifier` REQUIRED.
    uCode verifier required.aAccessDeniedErroru
    The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.
    aaccess_deniedaUnsupportedResponseTypeErroru
    The authorization server does not support obtaining an authorization
    code using this method.
    aunsupported_response_typeaUnsupportedCodeChallengeMethodErroru
    If the server supporting PKCE does not support the requested
    transformation, the authorization endpoint MUST return the
    authorization error response with "error" value set to
    "invalid_request".  The "error_description" or the response of
    "error_uri" SHOULD explain the nature of error, e.g., transform
    algorithm not supported.
    uTransform algorithm not supported.aInvalidScopeErroru
    The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed, or
    exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2
    ainvalid_scopeaServerErroru
    The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that
    prevented it from fulfilling the request.  (This error code is needed
    because a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status code cannot be returned
    to the client via a HTTP redirect.)
    aserver_erroraTemporarilyUnavailableErroru
    The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request
    due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.
    (This error code is needed because a 503 Service Unavailable HTTP
    status code cannot be returned to the client via a HTTP redirect.)
    atemporarily_unavailableaInvalidClientErroru
    Client authentication failed (e.g. unknown client, no client
    authentication included, or unsupported authentication method).
    The authorization server MAY return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status
    code to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.
    If the client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization" request
    header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an
    HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code, and include the "WWW-Authenticate"
    response header field matching the authentication scheme used by the
    client.
    ainvalid_clientaInvalidGrantErroru
    The provided authorization grant (e.g. authorization code, resource
    owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid, expired, revoked, does
    not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request, or was
    issued to another client.

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2
    ainvalid_grantaUnauthorizedClientErroru
    The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization
    grant type.
    aunauthorized_clientaUnsupportedGrantTypeErroru
    The authorization grant type is not supported by the authorization
    server.
    aunsupported_grant_typeaUnsupportedTokenTypeErroru
    The authorization server does not support the hint of the
    presented token type.  I.e. the client tried to revoke an access token
    on a server not supporting this feature.
    aunsupported_token_typeaInvalidTokenErroru
    The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or
    invalid for other reasons.  The resource SHOULD respond with
    the HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code.  The client MAY
    request a new access token and retry the protected resource
    request.
    ainvalid_tokenuThe access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or invalid for other reasons.aInsufficientScopeErroru
    The request requires higher privileges than provided by the
    access token.  The resource server SHOULD respond with the HTTP
    403 (Forbidden) status code and MAY include the "scope"
    attribute with the scope necessary to access the protected
    resource.
    ainsufficient_scopeluThe request requires higher privileges than provided by the access token.aConsentRequiredu
    The Authorization Server requires End-User consent.

    This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the
    Authentication Request is none, but the Authentication Request cannot be
    completed without displaying a user interface for End-User consent.
    aconsent_requiredaLoginRequiredu
    The Authorization Server requires End-User authentication.

    This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the
    Authentication Request is none, but the Authentication Request cannot be
    completed without displaying a user interface for End-User authentication.

    If the "code_challenge_method" from `Section 4.3`_ was "S256", the
    received "code_verifier" is hashed by SHA-256, base64url-encoded, and
    then compared to the "code_challenge", i.e.:

    BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier))) == code_challenge

    How to implement a base64url-encoding
    function without padding, based upon the standard base64-encoding
    function that uses padding.

    To be concrete, example C# code implementing these functions is shown
    below.  Similar code could be used in other languages.

    static string base64urlencode(byte [] arg)
    {
        string s = Convert.ToBase64String(arg); // Regular base64 encoder
        s = s.Split('=')[0]; // Remove any trailing '='s
        s = s.Replace('+', '-'); // 62nd char of encoding
        s = s.Replace('/', '_'); // 63rd char of encoding
        return s;
    }

    In python urlsafe_b64encode is already replacing '+' and '/', but preserve
    the trailing '='. So we have to remove it.

        The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
        parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
        using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per `Appendix B`_:

        response_type
                REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "code" for standard OAuth2
                authorization flow.  For OpenID Connect it must be one of
                "code token", "code id_token", or "code token id_token" - we
                essentially test that "code" appears in the response_type.
        client_id
                REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in `Section 2.2`_.
        redirect_uri
                OPTIONAL.  As described in `Section 3.1.2`_.
        scope
                OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
                `Section 3.3`_.
        state
                RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
                state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
                to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
                cross-site request forgery as described in `Section 10.12`_.

        The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
        HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
        user-agent.

        The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once. If an
        authorization code is used more than once, the authorization server
        MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens
        previously issued based on that authorization code. The authorization
        code is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.

        A normal error could be a missing response_type parameter or the client
        attempting to access scope it is not allowed to ask authorization for.
        Normal errors can safely be included in the redirection URI and
        sent back to the client.

        Fatal errors occur when the client_id or redirect_uri is invalid or
        missing. These must be caught by the provider and handled, how this
        is done is outside of the scope of OAuthLib but showing an error
        page describing the issue is a good idea.

    The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
    tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
    Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
    interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
    browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
    from the authorization server::

        +---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)

    Note: The lines illustrating steps (A), (B), and (C) are broken into
    two parts as they pass through the user-agent.

    Figure 3: Authorization Code Flow

    The flow illustrated in Figure 3 includes the following steps:

    (A)  The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's
         user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The client includes
         its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
         redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the
         user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).

    (B)  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via
         the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner
         grants or denies the client's access request.

    (C)  Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization
         server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the
         redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during
         client registration).  The redirection URI includes an
         authorization code and any local state provided by the client
         earlier.

    (D)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
         server's token endpoint by including the authorization code
         received in the previous step.  When making the request, the
         client authenticates with the authorization server.  The client
         includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization
         code for verification.

    (E)  The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the
         authorization code, and ensures that the redirection URI
         received matches the URI used to redirect the client in
         step (C).  If valid, the authorization server responds back with
         an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.

    OAuth 2.0 public clients utilizing the Authorization Code Grant are
    susceptible to the authorization code interception attack.

    A technique to mitigate against the threat through the use of Proof Key for Code
    Exchange (PKCE, pronounced "pixy") is implemented in the current oauthlib
    implementation.

    Container object for holding custom validator callables to be invoked
    as part of the grant type `validate_authorization_request()` or
    `validate_authorization_request()` methods on the various grant types.

    Authorization validators must be callables that take a request object and
    return a dict, which may contain items to be added to the `request_info`
    returned from the grant_type after validation.

    Token validators must be callables that take a request object and
    return None.

    Both authorization validators and token validators may raise OAuth2
    exceptions if validation conditions fail.

    Authorization validators added to `pre_auth` will be run BEFORE
    the standard validations (but after the critical ones that raise
    fatal errors) as part of `validate_authorization_request()`

    Authorization validators added to `post_auth` will be run AFTER
    the standard validations as part of `validate_authorization_request()`

    Token validators added to `pre_token` will be run BEFORE
    the standard validations as part of `validate_token_request()`

    Token validators added to `post_token` will be run AFTER
    the standard validations as part of `validate_token_request()`

    >>> auth_code_grant = AuthorizationCodeGrant(request_validator)

        The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
        parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
        using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per `Appendix B`_:

        response_type
                REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "token" for standard OAuth2 implicit flow
                           or "id_token token" or just "id_token" for OIDC implicit flow

        client_id
                REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in `Section 2.2`_.

        redirect_uri
                OPTIONAL.  As described in `Section 3.1.2`_.

        scope
                OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
                `Section 3.3`_.

        state
                RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
                state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
                to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
                cross-site request forgery as described in `Section 10.12`_.

        The authorization server validates the request to ensure that all
        required parameters are present and valid.  The authorization server
        MUST verify that the redirection URI to which it will redirect the
        access token matches a redirection URI registered by the client as
        described in `Section 3.1.2`_.

        If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
        server issues an access token and delivers it to the client by adding
        the following parameters to the fragment component of the redirection
        URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per
        `Appendix B`_:

        access_token
                REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.

        token_type
                REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
                `Section 7.1`_.  Value is case insensitive.

        expires_in
                RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
                example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
                expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
                If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
                expiration time via other means or document the default value.

        scope
                OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client;
                otherwise, REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as
                described by `Section 3.3`_.

        state
                REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
                authorization request.  The exact value received from the
                client.

        The authorization server MUST NOT issue a refresh token.

        This method is very similar to validate_authorization_request in
        the AuthorizationCodeGrant but differ in a few subtle areas.

        A normal error could be a missing response_type parameter or the client
        attempting to access scope it is not allowed to ask authorization for.
        Normal errors can safely be included in the redirection URI and
        sent back to the client.

        Fatal errors occur when the client_id or redirect_uri is invalid or
        missing. These must be caught by the provider and handled, how this
        is done is outside of the scope of OAuthLib but showing an error
        page describing the issue is a good idea.

    The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not
    support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public
    clients known to operate a particular redirection URI.  These clients
    are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language
    such as JavaScript.

    Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes
    separate requests for authorization and for an access token, the
    client receives the access token as the result of the authorization
    request.

    The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and
    relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of
    the redirection URI.  Because the access token is encoded into the
    redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other
    applications residing on the same device::

   Note: The lines illustrating steps (A) and (B) are broken into two
   parts as they pass through the user-agent.

   Figure 4: Implicit Grant Flow

   The flow illustrated in Figure 4 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's
        user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The client includes
        its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
        redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the
        user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via
        the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner
        grants or denies the client's access request.

   (C)  Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization
        server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the
        redirection URI provided earlier.  The redirection URI includes
        the access token in the URI fragment.

   (D)  The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a
        request to the web-hosted client resource (which does not
        include the fragment per [RFC2616]).  The user-agent retains the
        fragment information locally.

   (E)  The web-hosted client resource returns a web page (typically an
        HTML document with an embedded script) capable of accessing the
        full redirection URI including the fragment retained by the
        user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other
        parameters) contained in the fragment.

   (F)  The user-agent executes the script provided by the web-hosted
        client resource locally, which extracts the access token.

   (G)  The user-agent passes the access token to the client.

    See `Section 10.3`_ and `Section 10.16`_ for important security considerations
    when using the implicit grant.

        The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, in which case
        the client MUST discard the old refresh token and replace it with the
        new refresh token. The authorization server MAY revoke the old
        refresh token after issuing a new refresh token to the client. If a
        new refresh token is issued, the refresh token scope MUST be
        identical to that of the refresh token included by the client in the

        The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
        following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
        request entity-body:

        grant_type
                REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "password".

        username
                REQUIRED.  The resource owner username.

        password
                REQUIRED.  The resource owner password.

        scope
                OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
                `Section 3.3`_.

        If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client
        credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
        client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
        in `Section 3.2.1`_.

        The authorization server MUST:

        o  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
            client that was issued client credentials (or with other
            authentication requirements),

        o  authenticate the client if client authentication is included, and

        o  validate the resource owner password credentials using its
            existing password validation algorithm.

        Since this access token request utilizes the resource owner's
        password, the authorization server MUST protect the endpoint against
        brute force attacks (e.g., using rate-limitation or generating
        alerts).

    The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
    cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
    client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged
    application.  The authorization server should take special care when
    enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not
    viable.

    This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
    resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
    an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients
    using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
    authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
    access token::

    Figure 5: Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

    The flow illustrated in Figure 5 includes the following steps:

    (A)  The resource owner provides the client with its username and
            password.

    (B)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
            server's token endpoint by including the credentials received
            from the resource owner.  When making the request, the client
            authenticates with the authorization server.

    (C)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
            the resource owner credentials, and if valid, issues an access
            token.

    The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
    parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
    using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format as defined by
    [`W3C.REC-html401-19991224`_]:

    :param uri:
    :param client_id: The client identifier as described in `Section 2.2`_.

                          "code" and "token".
    :param redirect_uri: The client provided URI to redirect back to after
                         authorization as described in `Section 3.1.2`_.
    :param scope: The scope of the access request as described by
                  `Section 3.3`_.
    :param state: An opaque value used by the client to maintain
                  state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                  server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent
                  back to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for
                  preventing cross-site request forgery as described in
                  `Section 10.12`_.
    :param code_challenge: PKCE parameter. A challenge derived from the
                           code_verifier that is sent in the authorization
                           request, to be verified against later.
    :param code_challenge_method: PKCE parameter. A method that was used to derive the
                                  code_challenge. Defaults to "plain" if not present in the request.

    The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
    following parameters using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``
    format in the HTTP request entity-body:

    :param grant_type: To indicate grant type being used, i.e. "password",
                       "authorization_code" or "client_credentials".

    :param body: Existing request body (URL encoded string) to embed parameters
                 into. This may contain extra parameters. Default ''.

    :param include_client_id: `True` (default) to send the `client_id` in the
                              body of the upstream request. This is required
                              if the client is not authenticating with the
                              authorization server as described in
                              `Section 3.2.1`_.
    :type include_client_id: Boolean

    :param client_id: Unicode client identifier. Will only appear if
                      `include_client_id` is True. *

    :param client_secret: Unicode client secret. Will only appear if set to a
                          value that is not `None`. Invoking this function with
                          an empty string will send an empty `client_secret`
                          value to the server. *

    :param code: If using authorization_code grant, pass the previously
                 obtained authorization code as the ``code`` argument. *

    :param redirect_uri: If the "redirect_uri" parameter was included in the
                         authorization request as described in
                         `Section 4.1.1`_, and their values MUST be identical. *

    :param code_verifier: PKCE parameter. A cryptographically random string that is used to correlate the
                          authorization request to the token request.

    :param kwargs: Extra arguments to embed in the request body.

    Parameters marked with a `*` above are not explicit arguments in the
    function signature, but are specially documented arguments for items
    appearing in the generic `**kwargs` keyworded input.

    atokenatoken_type_hintDuContent-Typeuapplication/x-www-form-urlencodedacallbackuPrepare a token revocation request.

    The client constructs the request by including the following parameters
    using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format in the HTTP request
    entity-body:

    :param token: REQUIRED.  The token that the client wants to get revoked.

    :param token_type_hint: OPTIONAL.  A hint about the type of the token
                            submitted for revocation. Clients MAY pass this
                            parameter in order to help the authorization server
                            to optimize the token lookup.  If the server is
                            unable to locate the token using the given hint, it
                            MUST extend its search across all of its supported
                            token types.  An authorization server MAY ignore
                            this parameter, particularly if it is able to detect
                            the token type automatically.

    This specification defines two values for `token_type_hint`:

        * access_token: An access token as defined in [RFC6749],
             `Section 1.4`_

        * refresh_token: A refresh token as defined in [RFC6749],
             `Section 1.5`_

        Specific implementations, profiles, and extensions of this
        specification MAY define other values for this parameter using the
        registry defined in `Section 4.1.2`_.

    If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
    server issues an authorization code and delivers it to the client by
    adding the following parameters to the query component of the
    redirection URI using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format:

    **code**
            REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
            authorization server.  The authorization code MUST expire
            shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A
            maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
            RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code
            more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than
            once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
            revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
            that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
            the client identifier and redirection URI.

    **state**
            REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
            authorization request.  The exact value received from the
            client.

    :param uri: The full redirect URL back to the client.
    :param state: The state parameter from the authorization request.

    For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
    sending the following HTTP response:

    .. code-block:: http

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA

    If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
    server issues an access token and delivers it to the client by adding
    the following parameters to the fragment component of the redirection
    URI using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format:

    **access_token**
            REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.

    **token_type**
            REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
            Section 7.1.  Value is case insensitive.

    **expires_in**
            RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
            example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
            expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.

    **scope**
            OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client,
            otherwise REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as described
            by Section 3.3.

    **state**
            REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
            authorization request.  The exact value received from the
            client.

    :param uri:
    :param state:
    :param scope:

    Similar to the authorization code response, but with a full token provided
    in the URL fragment:

    .. code-block:: http

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: http://example.com/cb#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
                &state=xyz&token_type=example&expires_in=3600
    ajsonaloadsuParse the JSON token response body into a dict.

    The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
    token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters
    to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:

    access_token
            REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.
    token_type
            REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
            `Section 7.1`_.  Value is case insensitive.
    expires_in
            RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
            example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
            expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.
    refresh_token
            OPTIONAL.  The refresh token which can be used to obtain new
            access tokens using the same authorization grant as described
            in `Section 6`_.
    scope
            OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client,
            otherwise REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as described
            by `Section 3.3`_.

    The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
    using the "application/json" media type as defined by [`RFC4627`_].  The
    parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
    parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
    values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
    as JSON numbers.  The order of parameters does not matter and can
    vary.

    :param body: The full json encoded response body.
    :param scope: The scope requested during authorization.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: http

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        Means of authentication is negotiated beforehand and may for example
        be `HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme`_ which utilizes the Authorization
        header.

        Headers may be accesses through request.headers and parameters found in
        both body and query can be obtained by direct attribute access, i.e.
        request.client_id for client_id in the URL query.

        The authentication process is required to contain the identification of
        the client (i.e. search the database based on the client_id). In case the
        client doesn't exist based on the received client_id, this method has to
        return False and the HTTP response created by the library will contain
        'invalid_client' message.

        After the client identification succeeds, this method needs to set the
        client on the request, i.e. request.client = client. A client object's
        class must contain the 'client_id' attribute and the 'client_id' must have
        a value.

        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: True or False

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant
            - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (may be disabled)
            - Client Credentials Grant
            - Refresh Token Grant

        .. _`HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-11.1
        uEnsure client_id belong to a non-confidential client.

        A non-confidential client is one that is not required to authenticate
        through other means, such as using HTTP Basic.

        Note, while not strictly necessary it can often be very convenient
        to set request.client to the client object associated with the
        given client_id.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: True or False

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant
        uEnsure that the authorization process represented by this authorization
        code began with this 'redirect_uri'.

        If the client specifies a redirect_uri when obtaining code then that
        redirect URI must be bound to the code and verified equal in this
        method, according to RFC 6749 section 4.1.3.  Do not compare against
        the client's allowed redirect URIs, but against the URI used when the
        code was saved.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param code: Unicode authorization_code.
        :param redirect_uri: Unicode absolute URI.
        :param client: Client object set by you, see ``.authenticate_client``.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: True or False

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant (during token request)
        uGet the default redirect URI for the client.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: The default redirect URI for the client

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant
            - Implicit Grant
        uGet the default scopes for the client.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: List of default scopes

        Method is used by all core grant types:
            - Authorization Code Grant
            - Implicit Grant
            - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
            - Client Credentials grant
        uGet the list of scopes associated with the refresh token.

        :param refresh_token: Unicode refresh token.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: List of scopes.

        Method is used by:
            - Refresh token grant
        uIntrospect an access or refresh token.

        Called once the introspect request is validated. This method should
        verify the *token* and either return a dictionary with the list of
        claims associated, or `None` in case the token is unknown.

        Below the list of registered claims you should be interested in:

        - scope : space-separated list of scopes
        - client_id : client identifier
        - username : human-readable identifier for the resource owner
        - token_type : type of the token
        - exp : integer timestamp indicating when this token will expire
        - iat : integer timestamp indicating when this token was issued
        - nbf : integer timestamp indicating when it can be "not-before" used
        - sub : subject of the token - identifier of the resource owner
        - aud : list of string identifiers representing the intended audience
        - iss : string representing issuer of this token
        - jti : string identifier for the token

        Note that most of them are coming directly from JWT RFC. More details
        can be found in `Introspect Claims`_ or `JWT Claims`_.

        The implementation can use *token_type_hint* to improve lookup
        efficiency, but must fallback to other types to be compliant with RFC.

        The dict of claims is added to request.token after this method.

        :param token: The token string.
        :param token_type_hint: access_token or refresh_token.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Method is used by:
            - Introspect Endpoint (all grants are compatible)

        .. _`Introspect Claims`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.2
        .. _`JWT Claims`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4
        uInvalidate an authorization code after use.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param code: The authorization code grant (request.code).
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant
        uRevoke an access or refresh token.

        :param token: The token string.
        :param token_type_hint: access_token or refresh_token.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Method is used by:
            - Revocation Endpoint
        uPersist the authorization_code.

        The code should at minimum be stored with:
            - the client_id (``client_id``)
            - the redirect URI used (``request.redirect_uri``)
            - a resource owner / user (``request.user``)
            - the authorized scopes (``request.scopes``)

        To support PKCE, you MUST associate the code with:
            - Code Challenge (``request.code_challenge``) and
            - Code Challenge Method (``request.code_challenge_method``)

        To support OIDC, you MUST associate the code with:
            - nonce, if present (``code["nonce"]``)

        The ``code`` argument is actually a dictionary, containing at least a
        ``code`` key with the actual authorization code:

            ``{'code': 'sdf345jsdf0934f'}``

        It may also have a ``claims`` parameter which, when present, will be a dict
        deserialized from JSON as described at
        http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter
        This value should be saved in this method and used again in ``.validate_code``.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.
        :param code: A dict of the authorization code grant and, optionally, state.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Method is used by:
            - Authorization Code Grant
        asave_bearer_tokenuPersist the token with a token type specific method.

        Currently, only save_bearer_token is supported.

        :param token: A (Bearer) token dict.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        uPersist the Bearer token.

        The Bearer token should at minimum be associated with:
            - a client and it's client_id, if available
            - a resource owner / user (request.user)
            - authorized scopes (request.scopes)
            - an expiration time
            - a refresh token, if issued
            - a claims document, if present in request.claims

        The Bearer token dict may hold a number of items::

            {
                'token_type': 'Bearer',
                'access_token': 'askfjh234as9sd8',
                'expires_in': 3600,
                'scope': 'string of space separated authorized scopes',
                'refresh_token': '23sdf876234',  # if issued
                'state': 'given_by_client',  # if supplied by client (implicit ONLY)
            }

        Note that while "scope" is a string-separated list of authorized scopes,
        the original list is still available in request.scopes.

        The token dict is passed as a reference so any changes made to the dictionary
        will go back to the user.  If additional information must return to the client
        user, and it is only possible to get this information after writing the token
        to storage, it should be added to the token dictionary.  If the token
        dictionary must be modified but the changes should not go back to the user,
        a copy of the dictionary must be made before making the changes.

        Also note that if an Authorization Code grant request included a valid claims
        parameter (for OpenID Connect) then the request.claims property will contain
        the claims dict, which should be saved for later use when generating the
        id_token and/or UserInfo response content.

        :param token: A Bearer token dict.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request
        :rtype: The default redirect URI for the client

        Method is used by all core grant types issuing Bearer tokens:
            - Authorization Code Grant
            - Implicit Grant
            - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (might not associate a client)
            - Client Credentials grant
        uEnsure the Bearer token is valid and authorized access to scopes.

        :param token: A string of random characters.
        :param scopes: A list of scopes associated with the protected resource.
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        A key to OAuth 2 security and restricting impact of leaked tokens is
        the short expiration time of tokens, *always ensure the token has not
        expired!*.

        Two different approaches to scope validation:

            1) all(scopes). The token must be authorized access to all scopes
                            associated with the resource. For example, the
                            token has access to ``read-only`` and ``images``,
                            thus the client can view images but not upload new.
                            Allows for fine grained access control through
                            combining various scopes.

            2) any(scopes). The token must be authorized access to one of the
                            scopes associated with the resource. For example,
                            token has access to ``read-only-images``.
                            Allows for fine grained, although arguably less
                            convenient, access control.

        A powerful way to use scopes would mimic UNIX ACLs and see a scope
        as a group with certain privileges. For a restful API these might
        map to HTTP verbs instead of read, write and execute.

        Note, the request.user attribute can be set to the resource owner
        associated with this token. Similarly the request.client and
        request.scopes attribute can be set to associated client object
        and authorized scopes. If you then use a decorator such as the
        one provided for django these attributes will be made available
        in all protected views as keyword arguments.

        :param token: Unicode Bearer token
        :param scopes: List of scopes (defined by you)
        :param request: OAuthlib request.
        :type request: oauthlib.common.Request

        Method is indirectly used by all core Bearer token issuing grant types:
            - Authorization Code Grant
            - Implicit Grant
            - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
            - Client Credentials Grant
        uEnsure client_id belong to a valid and active client.

        Note, while not strictly necessary it can often be very convenient
        to set request.client to the client object associated with the
        given client_id.

        :param client_id: Unicode client identifier.

        uVerify that the authorization_code is valid and assigned to the given
        client.

        Before returning true, set the following based on the information stored
        with the code in 'save_authorization_code':

            - request.user
            - request.scopes
            - request.claims (if given)

        OBS! The request.user attribute should be set to the resource owner
        associated with this authorization code. Similarly request.scopes
        must also be set.

        The request.claims property, if it was given, should assigned a dict.

        If PKCE is enabled (see 'is_pkce_required' and 'save_authorization_code')
        you MUST set the following based on the information stored:

        uEnsure client is authorized to redirect to the redirect_uri requested.

        All clients should register the absolute URIs of all URIs they intend

        uEnsure the username and password is valid.

        OBS! The validation should also set the user attribute of the request
        to a valid resource owner, i.e. request.user = username or similar. If
        not set you will be unable to associate a token with a user in the

        According to the rfc6749, client authentication is required in the following cases:
            - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant, when Client type is Confidential or when
              Client was issued client credentials or whenever Client provided client
              authentication, see `Section 4.3.2`_.

              client credentials or whenever Client provided client authentication,
              see `Section 4.1.3`_.
            - Refresh Token Grant, when Client type is Confidential or when Client was issued
              client credentials or whenever Client provided client authentication, see

        When access tokens are refreshed the scope of the new token
        needs to be within the scope of the original token. This is
        ensured by checking that all requested scopes strings are on
        the list returned by the get_original_scopes. If this check
        fails, is_within_original_scope is called. The method can be
        used in situations where returning all valid scopes from the
        get_original_scopes is not practical.

        This is called for both "authorization" and "token" requests.

        Override this method by ``return True`` to enable PKCE for everyone.
        You might want to enable it only for public clients.
        Note that PKCE can also be used in addition of a client authentication.

        OAuth 2.0 public clients utilizing the Authorization Code Grant are
        susceptible to the authorization code interception attack.  This
        specification describes the attack as well as a technique to mitigate
        against the threat through the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange
        (PKCE, pronounced "pixy"). See `RFC7636`_.

        When the server issues the authorization code in the authorization
        response, it MUST associate the ``code_challenge`` and
        ``code_challenge_method`` values with the authorization code so it can
        be verified later.

        Typically, the ``code_challenge`` and ``code_challenge_method`` values
        are stored in encrypted form in the ``code`` itself but could
        alternatively be stored on the server associated with the code.  The
        server MUST NOT include the ``code_challenge`` value in client requests
        in a form that other entities can extract.

        Return the ``code_challenge`` associated to the code.
        If ``None`` is returned, code is considered to not be associated to any
        challenges.

        (Note:  If performing Authorization Code Grant via a public client such
        as a browser, you should use PKCE as well.)

        If this method returns true, the appropriate CORS headers will be added

    The client can request an access token using a device code and

    in RFC8628.

    The device authorization grant type can be used to obtain both
    access tokens and refresh tokens and is intended to be used in
    a scenario where the device being authorized does not have a

These regex are directly derived from the collected ABNF in RFC3986
(except for DIGIT, ALPHA and HEXDIG, defined by RFC2234).

They should be processed with re.VERBOSE.

    "MemAvailable", see:
    https://blog.famzah.net/2014/09/24/.

    This code reimplements the algorithm outlined here:
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/
        commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773

    We use this function also when "MemAvailable" returns 0 (possibly a
    kernel bug, see: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/1915).
    In that case this routine matches "free" CLI tool result ("available"
    column).

    XXX: on recent kernels this calculation may differ by ~1.5% compared
    to "MemAvailable:", as it's calculated slightly differently.
    It is still way more realistic than doing (free + cached) though.

        "0500000A:0016" -> ("10.0.0.5", 22)
        "0000000000000000FFFF00000100007F:9E49" -> ("::ffff:127.0.0.1", 40521)

        The IP address portion is a little or big endian four-byte
        hexadecimal number; that is, the least significant byte is listed
        first, so we need to reverse the order of the bytes to convert it
        to an IP address.
        The port is represented as a two-byte hexadecimal number.

    If the process terminated normally by calling exit(3) or _exit(2),
    or by returning from main(), the return value is the positive integer
    passed to *exit().

    If it was terminated by a signal it returns the negated value of the
    signal which caused the termination (e.g. -SIGTERM).

    If PID is not a children of os.getpid() (current process) just

    If PID does not exist at all return None immediately.

    If *timeout* != None and process is still alive raise TimeoutExpired.

        retrieval of multiple process information at the same time.

        Internally different process info (e.g. name, ppid, uids,
        gids, ...) may be fetched by using the same routine, but
        only one information is returned and the others are discarded.
        When using this context manager the internal routine is
        executed once (in the example below on name()) and the
        other info are cached.

        The cache is cleared when exiting the context manager block.
        The advice is to use this every time you retrieve more than
        one information about the process. If you're lucky, you'll
        get a hell of a speedup.

            namedtuple.
            Those are the number of read/write calls performed and the

            u'ioclass' argument must be specifiedaionice_getaionice_setuGet or set process I/O niceness (priority).

            On Linux *ioclass* is one of the IOPRIO_CLASS_* constants.
            *value* is a number which goes from 0 to 7. The higher the
            value, the lower the I/O priority of the process.

            On Windows only *ioclass* is used and it can be set to 2
            (normal), 1 (low) or 0 (very low).

            *resource* is one of the RLIMIT_* constants.
            *limits* is supposed to be a (soft, hard) tuple.

            See "man prlimit" for further info.
            Available on Linux and FreeBSD only.
            asortedacpu_affinity_geta_get_eligible_cpusTtTapercpuacpu_affinity_setuGet or set process CPU affinity.
            If specified, *cpus* must be a list of CPUs for which you
            want to set the affinity (e.g. [0, 1]).
            If an empty list is passed, all egible CPUs are assumed
            (and set).
            (Windows, Linux and BSD only).
            acpu_numuReturn what CPU this process is currently running on.
            The returned number should be <= psutil.cpu_count()
            and <= len(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)).
            It may be used in conjunction with
            psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True) to observe the system
            workload distributed across CPUs.
            aenvironuThe environment variables of the process as a dict.  Note: this
            might not reflect changes made after the process started.
            anum_handlesuReturn the number of handles opened by this process
            (Windows only).
            anum_ctx_switchesuReturn the number of voluntary and involuntary context
        switches performed by this process.
        anum_threadsuReturn the number of threads used by this process.athreadsuReturn threads opened by process as a list of
            (id, user_time, system_time) namedtuples representing
            thread id and thread CPU times (user/system).
            On OpenBSD this method requires root access.
            a_ppid_mapadefaultdictTOlistastackapopaseenaadduReturn the children of this process as a list of Process
        instances, pre-emptively checking whether PID has been reused.
        If *recursive* is True return all the parent descendants.

        Example (A == this process):

         A ─┐
            │
            ├─ B (child) ─┐
            │             └─ X (grandchild) ─┐
            │                                └─ Y (great grandchild)
            ├─ C (child)
            └─ D (child)

        >>> import psutil
        >>> p = psutil.Process()
        >>> p.children()
        B, C, D
        >>> p.children(recursive=True)
        B, X, Y, C, D

        Note that in the example above if process X disappears
        process Y won't be listed as the reference to process A
        is lost.
        Zuinterval is not positive (got %r)acpu_countlatimeruProcess.cpu_percent.<locals>.timerasleepauserasystemldanum_cpusarounduReturn a float representing the current process CPU
        utilization as a percentage.

        When *interval* is 0.0 or None (default) compares process times
        to system CPU times elapsed since last call, returning
        immediately (non-blocking). That means that the first time
        this is called it will return a meaningful 0.0 value.

        When *interval* is > 0.0 compares process times to system CPU
        times elapsed before and after the interval (blocking).

        In this case is recommended for accuracy that this function
        be called with at least 0.1 seconds between calls.

        A value > 100.0 can be returned in case of processes running
        multiple threads on different CPU cores.

        The returned value is explicitly NOT split evenly between
        all available logical CPUs. This means that a busy loop process
        running on a system with 2 logical CPUs will be reported as
        having 100% CPU utilization instead of 50%.

        Examples:

          >>> import psutil
          >>> p = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
          >>> # blocking
          >>> p.cpu_percent(interval=1)
          2.0
          >>> # non-blocking (percentage since last call)
          >>> p.cpu_percent(interval=None)
          2.9
          >>>
        a_timeruReturn a (user, system, children_user, children_system)
        namedtuple representing the accumulated process time, in
        seconds.
        This is similar to os.times() but per-process.
        On macOS and Windows children_user and children_system are
        always set to 0.
        uReturn a namedtuple with variable fields depending on the
        platform, representing memory information about the process.

        The "portable" fields available on all platforms are `rss` and `vms`.

        All numbers are expressed in bytes.
        amemory_full_infouThis method returns the same information as memory_info(),
        plus, on some platform (Linux, macOS, Windows), also provides
        additional metrics (USS, PSS and swap).
        The additional metrics provide a better representation of actual
        process memory usage.

        Namely USS is the memory which is unique to a process and which
        would be freed if the process was terminated right now.

        It does so by passing through the whole process address.
        As such it usually requires higher user privileges than
        memory_info() and is considerably slower.
        apfullmema_fieldsuinvalid memtype %r; valid types are %rapmema_TOTAL_PHYMEMavirtual_memoryatotalucan't calculate process memory percent because total physical system memory is not positive (%r)uCompare process memory to total physical system memory and
        calculate process memory utilization as a percentage.
        *memtype* argument is a string that dictates what type of
        process memory you want to compare against (defaults to "rss").
        The list of available strings can be obtained like this:

        >>> psutil.Process().memory_info()._fields
        ('rss', 'vms', 'shared', 'text', 'lib', 'data', 'dirty', 'uss', 'pss')
        amemory_mapsl:lnnu<lambda>uProcess.memory_maps.<locals>.<lambda>wdapmmap_groupedapmmap_extuReturn process' mapped memory regions as a list of namedtuples
            whose fields are variable depending on the platform.

            If *grouped* is True the mapped regions with the same 'path'
            are grouped together and the different memory fields are summed.

            If *grouped* is False every mapped region is shown as a single
            entity and the namedtuple will also include the mapped region's
            address space ('addr') and permission set ('perms').
            aopen_filesuReturn files opened by process as a list of
        (path, fd) namedtuples including the absolute file name
        and file descriptor number.
        aconnectionsuReturn socket connections opened by process as a list of
        (fd, family, type, laddr, raddr, status) namedtuples.
        The *kind* parameter filters for connections that match the
        following criteria:

        +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
        | Kind Value | Connections using                                  |

        instead of raising NoSuchProcess.

        If *timeout* (in seconds) is specified and process is still
        alive raise TimeoutExpired.

        To wait for multiple Process(es) use psutil.wait_procs().
        asubprocessaPopena_Popen__subprocDa_ignore_nsptastdoutacloseastderrastdina__getattribute__u%s instance has no attribute '%s'areturncodeuReturn a list of current running PIDs.uReturn True if given PID exists in the current process list.
    This is faster than doing "pid in psutil.pids()" and
    should be preferred.
    uReturn a generator yielding a Process instance for all
    running processes.

    Every new Process instance is only created once and then cached
    into an internal table which is updated every time this is used.

    Cached Process instances are checked for identity so that you're
    safe in case a PID has been reused by another process, in which
    case the cached instance is updated.

    The sorting order in which processes are yielded is based on
    their PIDs.

    *attrs* and *ad_value* have the same meaning as in
    Process.as_dict(). If *attrs* is specified as_dict() is called
    and the resulting dict is stored as a 'info' attribute attached
    to returned Process instance.
    If *attrs* is an empty list it will retrieve all process info
    (slow).

    terminate.

    Return a (gone, alive) tuple indicating which processes
    are gone and which ones are still alive.

    The gone ones will have a new *returncode* attribute indicating
    process exit status (may be None).

    *callback* is a function which gets called every time a process
    terminates (a Process instance is passed as callback argument).

    Function will return as soon as all processes terminate or when
    *timeout* occurs.
    Differently from Process.wait() it will not raise TimeoutExpired if
    *timeout* occurs.

    Typical use case is:

     - send SIGTERM to a list of processes
     - give them some time to terminate
     - send SIGKILL to those ones which are still alive

    Example:

    >>> def on_terminate(proc):
    ...     print("process {} terminated".format(proc))
    ...
    >>> for p in procs:
    ...    p.terminate()
    ...
    >>> gone, alive = wait_procs(procs, timeout=3, callback=on_terminate)
    >>> for p in alive:
    ...     p.kill()
    TatimeoutaTimeoutExpireda_SubprocessTimeoutExpiredacpu_count_logicalacpu_count_coresuReturn the number of logical CPUs in the system (same as
    os.cpu_count() in Python 3.4).

    If *logical* is False return the number of physical cores only
    (e.g. hyper thread CPUs are excluded).

    Return None if undetermined.

    The return value is cached after first call.
    If desired cache can be cleared like this:

    >>> psutil.cpu_count.cache_clear()
    aper_cpu_timesuReturn system-wide CPU times as a namedtuple.
    Every CPU time represents the seconds the CPU has spent in the
    given mode. The namedtuple's fields availability varies depending on the
    platform:

     - user
     - system
     - idle
     - nice (UNIX)
     - iowait (Linux)
     - irq (Linux, FreeBSD)
     - softirq (Linux)
     - steal (Linux >= 2.6.11)
     - guest (Linux >= 2.6.24)
     - guest_nice (Linux >= 3.2.0)

    When *percpu* is True return a list of namedtuples for each CPU.
    First element of the list refers to first CPU, second element
    to second CPU and so on.
    The order of the list is consistent across calls.
    aLINUXaguestaguest_niceuGiven a cpu_time() ntuple calculates the total CPU time
    (including idle time).
    a_cpu_tot_timeaidleaiowaituGiven a cpu_time() ntuple calculates the busy CPU time.
    We do so by subtracting all idle CPU times.
    ascputimesamaxafield_deltasacurrent_threadaidentacalculateucpu_percent.<locals>.calculatea_last_cpu_timesagetatida_last_per_cpu_timesuReturn a float representing the current system-wide CPU
    utilization as a percentage.

    When *interval* is > 0.0 compares system CPU times elapsed before
    and after the interval (blocking).

    When *interval* is 0.0 or None compares system CPU times elapsed
    since last call or module import, returning immediately (non
    blocking). That means the first time this is called it will
    return a meaningless 0.0 value which you should ignore.
    In this case is recommended for accuracy that this function be
    called with at least 0.1 seconds between calls.

    When *percpu* is True returns a list of floats representing the
    utilization as a percentage for each CPU.
    First element of the list refers to first CPU, second element
    to second CPU and so on.
    The order of the list is consistent across calls.

    Examples:

      >>> # blocking, system-wide
      >>> psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
      2.0
      >>>
      >>> # blocking, per-cpu
      >>> psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1, percpu=True)
      [2.0, 1.0]
      >>>
      >>> # non-blocking (percentage since last call)
      >>> psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)
      2.9
      >>>
    a_cpu_times_deltasa_cpu_busy_timeucpu_times_percent.<locals>.calculatea_last_cpu_times_2a_last_per_cpu_times_2uSame as cpu_percent() but provides utilization percentages
    for each specific CPU time as is returned by cpu_times().
    For instance, on Linux we'll get:

      >>> cpu_times_percent()
      cpupercent(user=4.8, nice=0.0, system=4.8, idle=90.5, iowait=0.0,
                 irq=0.0, softirq=0.0, steal=0.0, guest=0.0, guest_nice=0.0)
      >>>

    *interval* and *percpu* arguments have the same meaning as in
    cpu_percent().
    fY@ascaleanumsacpu_statsuReturn CPU statistics.acpu_freqTZZZutoo many values to unpack (expected 3)acurrsacurrentaminsamaxsaset_nonea_commonascpufrequReturn CPU frequency as a namedtuple including current,
        min and max frequency expressed in Mhz.

        If *percpu* is True and the system supports per-cpu frequency
        retrieval (Linux only) a list of frequencies is returned for
        each CPU. If not a list with one element is returned.
        uReturn statistics about system memory usage as a namedtuple
    including the following fields, expressed in bytes:

     - total:
       total physical memory available.

     - available:
       the memory that can be given instantly to processes without the
       system going into swap.
       This is calculated by summing different memory values depending
       on the platform and it is supposed to be used to monitor actual
       memory usage in a cross platform fashion.

     - percent:
       the percentage usage calculated as (total - available) / total * 100

     - used:
        memory used, calculated differently depending on the platform and
        designed for informational purposes only:
        macOS: active + wired
        BSD: active + wired + cached
        Linux: total - free

     - free:
       memory not being used at all (zeroed) that is readily available;
       note that this doesn't reflect the actual memory available
       (use 'available' instead)

    Platform-specific fields:

     - active (UNIX):
       memory currently in use or very recently used, and so it is in RAM.

     - inactive (UNIX):
       memory that is marked as not used.

     - buffers (BSD, Linux):
       cache for things like file system metadata.

     - cached (BSD, macOS):
       cache for various things.

     - wired (macOS, BSD):
       memory that is marked to always stay in RAM. It is never moved to disk.

     - shared (BSD):
       memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes.

    The sum of 'used' and 'available' does not necessarily equal total.
    On Windows 'available' and 'free' are the same.
    aswap_memoryuReturn system swap memory statistics as a namedtuple including
    the following fields:

     - total:   total swap memory in bytes
     - used:    used swap memory in bytes
     - free:    free swap memory in bytes
     - percent: the percentage usage
     - sin:     no. of bytes the system has swapped in from disk (cumulative)
     - sout:    no. of bytes the system has swapped out from disk (cumulative)

    'sin' and 'sout' on Windows are meaningless and always set to 0.
    adisk_usageuReturn disk usage statistics about the given *path* as a
    namedtuple including total, used and free space expressed in bytes
    plus the percentage usage.
    apathconfudisk_partitions.<locals>.pathconfadisk_partitionsa_replaceamountpointaPC_NAME_MAXaPC_PATH_MAXTamaxfileamaxpathanewuReturn mounted partitions as a list of
    (device, mountpoint, fstype, opts) namedtuple.
    'opts' field is a raw string separated by commas indicating mount
    options which may vary depending on the platform.

    If *all* parameter is False return physical devices only and ignore
    all others.
    TEOSErrorEAttributeErroraperdiskadisk_io_countersa_wrap_numbersupsutil.disk_io_countersasdiskioarawdictavaluesuReturn system disk I/O statistics as a namedtuple including
    the following fields:

     - read_count:  number of reads
     - write_count: number of writes
     - read_bytes:  number of bytes read
     - write_bytes: number of bytes written
     - read_time:   time spent reading from disk (in ms)
     - write_time:  time spent writing to disk (in ms)

    Platform specific:

     - busy_time: (Linux, FreeBSD) time spent doing actual I/Os (in ms)
     - read_merged_count (Linux): number of merged reads
     - write_merged_count (Linux): number of merged writes

    If *perdisk* is True return the same information for every
    physical disk installed on the system as a dictionary
    with partition names as the keys and the namedtuple
    described above as the values.

    If *nowrap* is True it detects and adjust the numbers which overflow
    and wrap (restart from 0) and add "old value" to "new value" so that
    the returned numbers will always be increasing or remain the same,
    but never decrease.
    "disk_io_counters.cache_clear()" can be used to invalidate the
    cache.

    On recent Windows versions 'diskperf -y' command may need to be
    executed first otherwise this function won't find any disk.
    u<genexpr>udisk_io_counters.<locals>.<genexpr>anet_io_countersupsutil.net_io_countersasnetiouReturn network I/O statistics as a namedtuple including
    the following fields:

     - bytes_sent:   number of bytes sent
     - bytes_recv:   number of bytes received
     - packets_sent: number of packets sent
     - packets_recv: number of packets received
     - errin:        total number of errors while receiving
     - errout:       total number of errors while sending
     - dropin:       total number of incoming packets which were dropped
     - dropout:      total number of outgoing packets which were dropped
                     (always 0 on macOS and BSD)

    If *pernic* is True return the same information for every
    network interface installed on the system as a dictionary
    with network interface names as the keys and the namedtuple
    described above as the values.

    If *nowrap* is True it detects and adjust the numbers which overflow
    and wrap (restart from 0) and add "old value" to "new value" so that
    the returned numbers will always be increasing or remain the same,
    but never decrease.
    "net_io_counters.cache_clear()" can be used to invalidate the
    cache.
    anet_connectionsuReturn system-wide socket connections as a list of
    (fd, family, type, laddr, raddr, status, pid) namedtuples.
    In case of limited privileges 'fd' and 'pid' may be set to -1
    and None respectively.
    The *kind* parameter filters for connections that fit the
    following criteria:

    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Kind Value | Connections using                                  |

    card) installed on the system as a dictionary whose keys are the
    NIC names and value is a list of namedtuples for each address
    assigned to the NIC. Each namedtuple includes 5 fields:

     - family: can be either socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6 or
               psutil.AF_LINK, which refers to a MAC address.
     - address: is the primary address and it is always set.
     - netmask: and 'broadcast' and 'ptp' may be None.
     - ptp: stands for "point to point" and references the
            destination address on a point to point interface
            (typically a VPN).
     - broadcast: and *ptp* are mutually exclusive.

    Note: you can have more than one address of the same family
    associated with each interface.
    anet_if_statsuReturn information about each NIC (network interface card)
    installed on the system as a dictionary whose keys are the
    NIC names and value is a namedtuple with the following fields:

     - isup: whether the interface is up (bool)
     - duplex: can be either NIC_DUPLEX_FULL, NIC_DUPLEX_HALF or
               NIC_DUPLEX_UNKNOWN
     - speed: the NIC speed expressed in mega bits (MB); if it can't
              be determined (e.g. 'localhost') it will be set to 0.
     - mtu: the maximum transmission unit expressed in bytes.
    aconvertusensors_temperatures.<locals>.convertasensors_temperaturesTlutoo many values to unpack (expected 4)ashwtempahighacriticaluReturn hardware temperatures. Each entry is a namedtuple
        representing a certain hardware sensor (it may be a CPU, an
        hard disk or something else, depending on the OS and its
        configuration).
        All temperatures are expressed in celsius unless *fahrenheit*
        is set to True.
        afahrenheitll asensors_fansuReturn fans speed. Each entry is a namedtuple
        representing a certain hardware sensor.
        All speed are expressed in RPM (rounds per minute).
        asensors_batteryuReturn battery information. If no battery is installed
        returns None.

         - percent: battery power left as a percentage.
         - secsleft: a rough approximation of how many seconds are left
                     before the battery runs out of power. May be

    If PID is omitted current process PID (os.getpid()) is used.
    Raise NoSuchProcess if PID does not exist.

    Note that most of the methods of this class do not make sure
    the PID of the process being queried has been reused over time.
    That means you might end up retrieving an information referring
    to another process in case the original one this instance
    refers to is gone in the meantime.

    The only exceptions for which process identity is pre-emptively
    checked and guaranteed are:

     - parent()
     - children()
     - nice() (set)
     - ionice() (set)
     - rlimit() (set)
     - cpu_affinity (set)
     - suspend()
     - resume()
     - send_signal()
     - terminate()
     - kill()

    To prevent this problem for all other methods you can:
     - use is_running() before querying the process
     - if you're continuously iterating over a set of Process

    For the following methods which are common to both classes, psutil
    implementation takes precedence:

    * send_signal()
    * terminate()
    * kill()

    This is done in order to avoid killing another process in case its
    PID has been reused, fixing BPO-6973.

                        The decode(..., substrateFun=userCallback) option was introduced in 0.1.4 as a generalization
                        of the old recursiveFlag=False option. Users should pass their callback instead of using
                        recursiveFlag.

                substrateFun API has changed in 0.5 for use with streaming decoders. To stay backwards compatible,
                we first try if we received a streaming user callback. If that fails,we assume we've received a
                non-streaming v0.4 user callback and convert it for streaming on the fly

        Takes BER/CER/DER octet-stream in form of :py:class:`bytes` (Python 3)
        or :py:class:`str` (Python 2) and decode it into an ASN.1 object
        (e.g. :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item` derivative) which
        may be a scalar or an arbitrary nested structure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        substrate: :py:class:`bytes` (Python 3) or :py:class:`str` (Python 2)
            BER/CER/DER octet-stream to parse

        Keyword Args
        ------------
        asn1Spec: :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item`
            A pyasn1 type object (:py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item`
            derivative) to act as a template guiding the decoder.
            Depending on the ASN.1 structure being decoded, `asn1Spec` may or
            may not be required. Most common reason for it to require is that
            ASN.1 structure is encoded in *IMPLICIT* tagging mode.

        substrateFun: :py:class:`Union[
                Callable[[pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item, bytes, int],
                         Tuple[pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item, bytes]],
                Callable[[pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item, io.BytesIO, int, dict],
                         Generator[Union[pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item,
                                         pyasn1.error.SubstrateUnderrunError],
                                   None, None]]
            ]`
            User callback meant to generalize special use cases like non-recursive or
            partial decoding. A 3-arg non-streaming variant is supported for backwards
            compatiblilty in addition to the newer 4-arg streaming variant.
            The callback will receive the uninitialized object recovered from substrate
            as 1st argument, the uninterpreted payload as 2nd argument, and the length
            of the uninterpreted payload as 3rd argument. The streaming variant will
            additionally receive the decode(..., **options) kwargs as 4th argument.
            The non-streaming variant shall return an object that will be propagated
            as decode() return value as 1st item, and the remainig payload for further
            decode passes as 2nd item.
            The streaming variant shall yield an object that will be propagated as
            decode() return value, and leave the remaining payload in the stream.

        Returns
        -------
        : :py:class:`tuple`
            A tuple of :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item` object
            recovered from BER/CER/DER substrate and the unprocessed trailing
            portion of the `substrate` (may be empty)

        Raises
        ------
        : :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.PyAsn1Error`
            :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.SubstrateUnderrunError` on insufficient
            input or :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.PyAsn1Error` on decoding error.

lutoo many values to unpack (expected 10)TTlpaSingleItemDecodera__init__uSingleItemDecoder.__init__uCreate an iterator that turns BER/CER/DER byte stream into ASN.1 objects.

    On each iteration, consume whatever BER/CER/DER serialization is
    available in the `substrate` stream-like object and turns it into
    one or more, possibly nested, ASN.1 objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    substrate: :py:class:`file`, :py:class:`io.BytesIO`
        BER/CER/DER serialization in form of a byte stream

    Keyword Args
    ------------
    asn1Spec: :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item`
        A pyasn1 type object to act as a template guiding the decoder.
        Depending on the ASN.1 structure being decoded, `asn1Spec` may
        or may not be required. One of the reasons why `asn1Spec` may
        me required is that ASN.1 structure is encoded in the *IMPLICIT*
        tagging mode.

    Yields
    ------
    : :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item`, :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.SubstrateUnderrunError`
        Decoded ASN.1 object (possibly, nested) or
        :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.SubstrateUnderrunError` object indicating
        insufficient BER/CER/DER serialization on input to fully recover ASN.1
        objects from it.

        In the latter case the caller is advised to ensure some more data in
        the input stream, then call the iterator again. The decoder will resume
        the decoding process using the newly arrived data.

        The `context` property of :py:class:`~pyasn1.error.SubstrateUnderrunError`
        object might hold a reference to the partially populated ASN.1 object
        being reconstructed.

    Raises
    ------
    ~pyasn1.error.PyAsn1Error, ~pyasn1.error.EndOfStreamError
        `PyAsn1Error` on deserialization error, `EndOfStreamError` on
         premature stream closure.

        Note
        ----
        There is an important distinction between PyASN1 schema and value objects.
        The PyASN1 schema objects can only participate in ASN.1 schema-related
        operations (e.g. defining or testing the structure of the data). Most
        obvious uses of ASN.1 schema is to guide serialisation codecs whilst
        encoding/decoding serialised ASN.1 contents.

        The PyASN1 value objects can **additionally** participate in many operations
        involving regular Python objects (e.g. arithmetic, comprehension etc).
        acopyuCreate a modified version of |ASN.1| schema or value object.

        The `clone()` method accepts the same set arguments as |ASN.1|
        class takes on instantiation except that all arguments
        of the `clone()` method are optional.

        Whatever arguments are supplied, they are used to create a copy
        of `self` taking precedence over the ones used to instantiate `self`.

        Note
        ----
        Due to the immutable nature of the |ASN.1| object, if no arguments
        are supplied, no new |ASN.1| object will be created and `self` will
        be returned instead.
        aimplicitTagatagImplicitlyapopTaexplicitTagnatagExplicitlyainitializersuCreate a specialization of |ASN.1| schema or value object.

        The subtype relationship between ASN.1 types has no correlation with
        subtype relationship between Python types. ASN.1 type is mainly identified
        by its tag(s) (:py:class:`~pyasn1.type.tag.TagSet`) and value range
        constraints (:py:class:`~pyasn1.type.constraint.ConstraintsIntersection`).
        These ASN.1 type properties are implemented as |ASN.1| attributes.

        The `subtype()` method accepts the same set arguments as |ASN.1|
        class takes on instantiation except that all parameters
        of the `subtype()` method are optional.

        With the exception of the arguments described below, the rest of
        supplied arguments they are used to create a copy of `self` taking
        precedence over the ones used to instantiate `self`.

        The following arguments to `subtype()` create a ASN.1 subtype out of
        |ASN.1| type:

        -------
        :
            new instance of |ASN.1| schema or value object

        Note
        ----
        Due to the immutable nature of the |ASN.1| object, if no arguments
        are supplied, no new |ASN.1| object will be created and `self` will
        be returned instead.
        aprettyOutu%s -> %sacomponentTypeasizeSpeca_moveSizeSpecu, %s=%racomponentsu, TuMethod not implementedacloneValueFlaga_cloneComponentValuesacloneuCreate a modified version of |ASN.1| schema object.

        The `clone()` method accepts the same set arguments as |ASN.1|
        class takes on instantiation except that all arguments
        of the `clone()` method are optional.

        Whatever arguments are supplied, they are used to create a copy
        of `self` taking precedence over the ones used to instantiate `self`.

        Possible values of `self` are never copied over thus `clone()` can
        only create a new schema object.

        Returns
        -------
        :
            new instance of |ASN.1| type/value

        Note
        ----
        Due to the mutable nature of the |ASN.1| object, even if no arguments
        are supplied, a new |ASN.1| object will be created and returned.
        TaimplicitTagnuCreate a specialization of |ASN.1| schema object.

        The `subtype()` method accepts the same set arguments as |ASN.1|
        class takes on instantiation except that all parameters
        of the `subtype()` method are optional.

        With the exception of the arguments described below, the rest of
        supplied arguments they are used to create a copy of `self` taking
        precedence over the ones used to instantiate `self`.

        The following arguments to `subtype()` create a ASN.1 subtype out of
        |ASN.1| type.

    |ASN.1| class is based on :class:`~pyasn1.type.base.SimpleAsn1Type`,
    its objects are immutable and duck-type Python 2 :class:`str` or Python 3
    :class:`bytes`. When used in octet-stream context, |ASN.1| type assumes
    "|encoding|" encoding.

    Keyword Args
    ------------
    value: :class:`unicode`, :class:`str`, :class:`bytes` or |ASN.1| object
        :class:`unicode` object (Python 2) or :class:`str` (Python 3),
        alternatively :class:`str` (Python 2) or :class:`bytes` (Python 3)
        representing octet-stream of serialised unicode string
        (note `encoding` parameter) or |ASN.1| class instance.
        If `value` is not given, schema object will be created.

    tagSet: :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.tag.TagSet`
        Object representing non-default ASN.1 tag(s)

    subtypeSpec: :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.constraint.ConstraintsIntersection`
        Object representing non-default ASN.1 subtype constraint(s). Constraints
        verification for |ASN.1| type occurs automatically on object
        instantiation.

    encoding: :py:class:`str`
        Unicode codec ID to encode/decode :class:`unicode` (Python 2) or
        :class:`str` (Python 3) the payload when |ASN.1| object is used
        in octet-stream context.

    Raises

    uContainedSubtypeConstraint._testValueaValueRangeConstraintuCreate a ValueRangeConstraint object.

    The ValueRangeConstraint satisfies any value that
    falls in the range of permitted values.

    The ValueRangeConstraint object can only be applied
    to :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Integer` and
    :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Real` types.

    Note
    ----
    Whenever ValueSizeConstraint is applied to mutable types
    (e.g. :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.SequenceOf`,
    :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.SetOf`), constraint
    validation only happens at the serialisation phase rather
    than schema instantiation phase (as it is with immutable
    types).
    uValueSizeConstraint._testValueaPermittedAlphabetConstraintuCreate a PermittedAlphabetConstraint object.

    The PermittedAlphabetConstraint satisfies any character
    string for as long as all its characters are present in
    the set of permitted characters.

    Objects of this type are iterable (emitting constraint values) and
    can act as operands for some arithmetic operations e.g. addition
    and subtraction.

    The PermittedAlphabetConstraint object can only be applied
    to the :ref:`character ASN.1 types <type.char>` such as
    :class:`~pyasn1.type.char.IA5String`.

    Parameters

        garbage = BooleanValue('TAF')

    ASN.1 `FROM ... EXCEPT ...` clause can be modelled by combining multiple
    PermittedAlphabetConstraint objects into one:

    Example
    -------
    .. code-block:: python

        class Lipogramme(IA5String):
            '''
            ASN.1 specification:

            Lipogramme ::=
                IA5String (FROM (ALL EXCEPT ("e"|"E")))
            '''
            subtypeSpec = (
                PermittedAlphabetConstraint(*string.printable) -
                PermittedAlphabetConstraint('e', 'E')
            )

        # this will succeed
        lipogramme = Lipogramme('A work of fiction?')

        # this will raise ValueConstraintError
        lipogramme = Lipogramme('Eel')

    Note
    ----
    Although `ConstraintsExclusion` object could seemingly be used for this
    purpose, practically, for it to work, it needs to represent its operand
    constraints as sets and intersect one with the other. That would require
    the insight into the constraint values (and their types) that are otherwise
    hidden inside the constraint object.

    Therefore it's more practical to model `EXCEPT` clause at
    `PermittedAlphabetConstraint` level instead.
    uPermittedAlphabetConstraint._setValuesuPermittedAlphabetConstraint._testValueaComponentPresentConstraintuCreate a ComponentPresentConstraint object.

    The ComponentPresentConstraint is only satisfied when the value
    is not `None`.

    The ComponentPresentConstraint object is typically used with
    `WithComponentsConstraint`.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

        present = ComponentPresentConstraint()

        # this will succeed
        present('whatever')

        # this will raise ValueConstraintError
        present(None)
    uComponentPresentConstraint._setValuesuComponentPresentConstraint._testValueaComponentAbsentConstraintuCreate a ComponentAbsentConstraint object.

    The ComponentAbsentConstraint is only satisfied when the value
    is `None`.

    The ComponentAbsentConstraint object is typically used with
    `WithComponentsConstraint`.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

        absent = ComponentAbsentConstraint()

        # this will succeed
        absent(None)

        # this will raise ValueConstraintError
        absent('whatever')
    uComponentAbsentConstraint._setValuesuComponentAbsentConstraint._testValueaWithComponentsConstraintuCreate a WithComponentsConstraint object.

    The `WithComponentsConstraint` satisfies any mapping object that has
    constrained fields present or absent, what is indicated by
    `ComponentPresentConstraint` and `ComponentAbsentConstraint`
    objects respectively.

    The `WithComponentsConstraint` object is typically applied
    to  :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Set` or
    :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Sequence` types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *fields: :class:`tuple`
        Zero or more tuples of (`field`, `constraint`) indicating constrained
        fields.

    Notes
    -----
    On top of the primary use of `WithComponentsConstraint` (ensuring presence
    or absence of particular components of a :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Set` or
    :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Sequence`), it is also possible to pass any other
    constraint objects or their combinations. In case of scalar fields, these
    constraints will be verified in addition to the constraints belonging to
    scalar components themselves. However, formally, these additional
    constraints do not change the type of these ASN.1 objects.

    Examples
    --------

    .. code-block:: python

    Note
    ----
    The `FROM ... EXCEPT ...` ASN.1 clause should be modeled by combining
    constraint objects into one. See `PermittedAlphabetConstraint` for more
    information.

           OuterType ::= CHOICE {
               innerType INTEGER
           }

    The *OpenType* object models an untyped field of a constructed ASN.1
    type. In ASN.1 syntax it is usually represented by the
    `ANY DEFINED BY` for scalars or `SET OF ANY DEFINED BY`,
    `SEQUENCE OF ANY DEFINED BY` for container types clauses. Typically
    used together with :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Any` object.

    OpenType objects duck-type a read-only Python :class:`dict` objects,
    however the passed `typeMap` is not copied, but stored by reference.
    That means the user can manipulate `typeMap` at run time having this
    reflected on *OpenType* object behavior.

    The |OpenType| class models an untyped field of a constructed ASN.1
    type. In ASN.1 syntax it is usually represented by the
    `ANY DEFINED BY` for scalars or `SET OF ANY DEFINED BY`,
    `SEQUENCE OF ANY DEFINED BY` for container types clauses. Typically
    used with :class:`~pyasn1.type.univ.Any` type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: :py:class:`str`
        Field name

    typeMap: :py:class:`dict`
        A map of value->ASN.1 type. It's stored by reference and can be
        mutated later to register new mappings.

    Examples
    --------

        Parameters
        ----------
        idx : :class:`int`
            Component index (zero-based). Must either refer to an existing
            component or to N+1 component (if *componentType* is set). In the latter
            case a new component type gets instantiated and appended to the |ASN.1|

        Equivalent to Python sequence item assignment operation (e.g. `[]`)
        or list.append() (when idx == len(self)).

        Parameters
        ----------
        idx: :class:`int`
            Component index (zero-based). Must either refer to existing
            component or to N+1 component. In the latter case a new component
            type gets instantiated (if *componentType* is set, or given ASN.1
            object is taken otherwise) and appended to the |ASN.1| sequence.

        Keyword Args
        ------------
        value: :class:`object` or :py:class:`~pyasn1.type.base.PyAsn1Item` derivative
            A Python value to initialize |ASN.1| component with (if *componentType* is set)
            or ASN.1 value object to assign to |ASN.1| component.
            If `value` is not given, schema object will be set as a component.

w}uIndicate that |ASN.1| object represents ASN.1 value.

        If *isValue* is :obj:`False` then this object represents just ASN.1 schema.

        If *isValue* is :obj:`True` then, in addition to its ASN.1 schema features,
        this object can also be used like a Python built-in object
        (e.g. :class:`int`, :class:`str`, :class:`dict` etc.).

        Returns
        -------
        : :class:`bool`
            :obj:`False` if object represents just ASN.1 schema.
            :obj:`True` if object represents ASN.1 schema and can be used as a normal value.

        Note
        ----
        There is an important distinction between PyASN1 schema and value objects.
        The PyASN1 schema objects can only participate in ASN.1 schema-related
        operations (e.g. defining or testing the structure of the data). Most
        obvious uses of ASN.1 schema is to guide serialisation codecs whilst
        encoding/decoding serialised ASN.1 contents.

        The PyASN1 value objects can **additionally** participate in many operations
        involving regular Python objects (e.g. arithmetic, comprehension etc).
        asubtypeSpecamappinguRun necessary checks to ensure |ASN.1| object consistency.

        Default action is to verify |ASN.1| object against constraints imposed
        by `subtypeSpec`.

        Raises

        anamedTypesaisOptionaluIndicate that |ASN.1| object represents ASN.1 value.

        If *isValue* is :obj:`False` then this object represents just ASN.1 schema.

        If *isValue* is :obj:`True` then, in addition to its ASN.1 schema features,
        this object can also be used like a Python built-in object (e.g.
        :class:`int`, :class:`str`, :class:`dict` etc.).

        Returns
        -------
        : :class:`bool`
            :obj:`False` if object represents just ASN.1 schema.

            normal value.

        Note
        ----
        There is an important distinction between PyASN1 schema and value objects.
        The PyASN1 schema objects can only participate in ASN.1 schema-related
        operations (e.g. defining or testing the structure of the data). Most
        obvious uses of ASN.1 schema is to guide serialisation codecs whilst
        encoding/decoding serialised ASN.1 contents.

        The PyASN1 value objects can **additionally** participate in many operations
        involving regular Python objects (e.g. arithmetic, comprehension etc).

        It is sufficient for |ASN.1| objects to have all non-optional and non-defaulted
        components being value objects to be considered as a value objects as a whole.
        In other words, even having one or more optional components not turned into
        value objects, |ASN.1| object is still considered as a value object. Defaulted
        components are normally value objects by default.

    These examples belong in the UTC class above, but it is obscured; or in
    the README.rst, but we are not depending on Python 2.4 so integrating
    the README.rst examples with the unit tests is not trivial.

    An offset of 0 is special-cased to return UTC.

    There should always be only one instance of a FixedOffset per timedelta.

        datetime.astimezone(). Currently normalize() also works:

        >>> la = timezone('America/Los_Angeles')
        >>> dt = la.localize(datetime(2011, 5, 7, 1, 2, 3))
        >>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'
        >>> gmt.normalize(dt).strftime(fmt)
        '2011-05-07 08:02:03 GMT (+0000)'
        u<StaticTzInfo %r>apytza_pa_tzinfosutoo many values to unpack (expected 3)a_dsta_transition_info:lnnaselfTnamaxabisect_righta_utc_transition_timesafromutcuCorrect the timezone information on the given datetime

        If date arithmetic crosses DST boundaries, the tzinfo
        is not magically adjusted. This method normalizes the
        tzinfo to the correct one.

        To test, first we need to do some setup

        >>> from pytz import timezone
        >>> utc = timezone('UTC')
        >>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')
        >>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'

        We next create a datetime right on an end-of-DST transition point,
        the instant when the wallclocks are wound back one hour.

        >>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)
        >>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)
        >>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)
        '2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST (-0500)'

        Now, if we subtract a few minutes from it, note that the timezone
        information has not changed.

        >>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)
        >>> before.strftime(fmt)
        '2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST (-0500)'

        But we can fix that by calling the normalize method

        >>> before = eastern.normalize(before)
        >>> before.strftime(fmt)
        '2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT (-0400)'

        The supported method of converting between timezones is to use
        datetime.astimezone(). Currently, normalize() also works:

        >>> th = timezone('Asia/Bangkok')
        >>> am = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')
        >>> dt = th.localize(datetime(2011, 5, 7, 1, 2, 3))
        >>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'
        >>> am.normalize(dt).strftime(fmt)
        '2011-05-06 20:02:03 CEST (+0200)'

        This method should be used to construct localtimes, rather
        than passing a tzinfo argument to a datetime constructor.

        is_dst is used to determine the correct timezone in the ambigous
        period at the end of daylight saving time.

        >>> from pytz import timezone
        >>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z (%z)'
        >>> amdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')
        >>> dt  = datetime(2004, 10, 31, 2, 0, 0)
        >>> loc_dt1 = amdam.localize(dt, is_dst=True)
        >>> loc_dt2 = amdam.localize(dt, is_dst=False)
        >>> loc_dt1.strftime(fmt)
        '2004-10-31 02:00:00 CEST (+0200)'
        >>> loc_dt2.strftime(fmt)
        '2004-10-31 02:00:00 CET (+0100)'
        >>> str(loc_dt2 - loc_dt1)
        '1:00:00'

        Use is_dst=None to raise an AmbiguousTimeError for ambiguous
        times at the end of daylight saving time

        >>> try:
        ...     loc_dt1 = amdam.localize(dt, is_dst=None)
        ... except AmbiguousTimeError:
        ...     print('Ambiguous')
        Ambiguous

        is_dst defaults to False

        >>> amdam.localize(dt) == amdam.localize(dt, False)
        True

        is_dst is also used to determine the correct timezone in the
        wallclock times jumped over at the start of daylight saving time.

        >>> pacific = timezone('US/Pacific')
        >>> dt = datetime(2008, 3, 9, 2, 0, 0)
        >>> ploc_dt1 = pacific.localize(dt, is_dst=True)
        >>> ploc_dt2 = pacific.localize(dt, is_dst=False)
        >>> ploc_dt1.strftime(fmt)
        '2008-03-09 02:00:00 PDT (-0700)'
        >>> ploc_dt2.strftime(fmt)
        '2008-03-09 02:00:00 PST (-0800)'
        >>> str(ploc_dt2 - ploc_dt1)
        '1:00:00'

        Use is_dst=None to raise a NonExistentTimeError for these skipped
        times.

        >>> try:
        ...     loc_dt1 = pacific.localize(dt, is_dst=None)
        ... except NonExistentTimeError:
        ...     print('Non-existent')
        Non-existent
        uSee datetime.tzinfo.utcoffset

        The is_dst parameter may be used to remove ambiguity during DST
        transitions.

        >>> from pytz import timezone
        >>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')
        >>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)

    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and
    HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter interface. This class will
    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
        connections. If you need granular control over the conditions under
        which we retry a request, import urllib3's ``Retry`` class and pass
        that instead.
    :param pool_block: Whether the connection pool should block for connections.

    Usage::

      >>> import requests
      >>> s = requests.Session()
      >>> a = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=3)
      >>> s.mount('http://', a)

        or a 4-tuple ``('filename', fileobj, 'content_type', custom_headers)``, where ``'content-type'`` is a string
        defining the content type of the given file and ``custom_headers`` a dict-like object containing additional headers
        to add for the file.
    :param auth: (optional) Auth tuple to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.
    :param timeout: (optional) How many seconds to wait for the server to send data

Requests HTTP Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.
Basic GET usage:

   >>> import requests
   >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
   >>> r.status_code
   200
   >>> b'Python is a programming language' in r.content
   True

... or POST:

   >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
   >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
   >>> print(r.text)
   {
     ...
     "form": {
       "key1": "value1",
       "key2": "value2"
     },
     ...
   }

The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
is at <https://requests.readthedocs.io>.

    The code in `cookielib.CookieJar` expects this interface in order to correctly
    manage cookie policies, i.e., determine whether a cookie can be set, given the
    domains of the request and the cookie.

    The original request object is read-only. The client is responsible for collecting
    the new headers via `get_new_headers()` and interpreting them appropriately. You
    probably want `get_cookie_header`, defined below.

    a__orig_bases__uCompatibility class; is a cookielib.CookieJar, but exposes a dict
    interface.

    This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and sessions that
    don't specify one, since some clients may expect response.cookies and
    session.cookies to support dict operations.

    Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it's just for
    compatibility with external client code. All requests code should work
    out of the box with externally provided instances of ``CookieJar``, e.g.
    ``LWPCookieJar`` and ``FileCookieJar``.

    Unlike a regular CookieJar, this class is pickleable.

        This function eventually generates a ``Cookie`` header from the

        will not be regenerated if it already exists, meaning this function
        can only be called once for the life of the
        :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` object. Any subsequent calls
        to ``prepare_cookies`` will have no actual effect, unless the "Cookie"
        header is removed beforehand.

When stream=True is set on the

        read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
        returned as decoding can take place.

        chunk_size must be of type int or None. A value of None will
        function differently depending on the value of `stream`.
        stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
        chunks are received. If stream=False, data is returned as
        a single chunk.

The ``codes`` object defines a mapping from common names for HTTP statuses
to their numerical codes, accessible either as attributes or as dictionary
items.

Example::

    >>> import requests
    >>> requests.codes['temporary_redirect']
    307
    >>> requests.codes.teapot
    418
    >>> requests.codes['\o/']
    200

Some codes have multiple names, and both upper- and lower-case versions of
the names are allowed. For example, ``codes.ok``, ``codes.OK``, and
``codes.okay`` all correspond to the HTTP status code 200.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data structures that power Requests.
a__doc__a__file__a__spec__aoriginahas_locationa__cached__acollectionsTaOrderedDictlacompatTaMappingaMutableMappingaMutableMappinga__prepare__a__getitem__u%s.__prepare__() must return a mapping, not %sa__name__u<metaclass>urequests.structuresa__module__uA case-insensitive ``dict``-like object.

    Implements all methods and operations of
    ``MutableMapping`` as well as dict's ``copy``. Also
    provides ``lower_items``.

    All keys are expected to be strings. The structure remembers the
    case of the last key to be set, and ``iter(instance)``,
    ``keys()``, ``items()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``iteritems()``
    will contain case-sensitive keys. However, querying and contains
    testing is case insensitive::

        cid = CaseInsensitiveDict()
        cid['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        cid['aCCEPT'] == 'application/json'  # True
        list(cid) == ['Accept']  # True

    For example, ``headers['content-encoding']`` will return the
    value of a ``'Content-Encoding'`` response header, regardless
    of how the header name was originally stored.

    If the constructor, ``.update``, or equality comparison
    operations are given keys that have equal ``.lower()``s, the
    behavior is undefined.

    a_parse_list_header:lnn:nlnw"aunquote_header_value:llnaresultaappenduParse lists as described by RFC 2068 Section 2.

    In particular, parse comma-separated lists where the elements of
    the list may include quoted-strings.  A quoted-string could
    contain a comma.  A non-quoted string could have quotes in the
    middle.  Quotes are removed automatically after parsing.

    It basically works like :func:`parse_set_header` just that items
    may appear multiple times and case sensitivity is preserved.

    The return value is a standard :class:`list`:

    >>> parse_list_header('token, "quoted value"')
    ['token', 'quoted value']

    To create a header from the :class:`list` again, use the
    :func:`dump_header` function.

    :param value: a string with a list header.
    :return: :class:`list`
    :rtype: list
    w=Tw=luParse lists of key, value pairs as described by RFC 2068 Section 2 and
    convert them into a python dict:

    >>> type(d) is dict
    True
    >>> sorted(d.items())
    [('bar', 'as well'), ('foo', 'is a fish')]

    If there is no value for a key it will be `None`:

    >>> parse_dict_header('key_without_value')
    {'key_without_value': None}

    To create a header from the :class:`dict` again, use the
    :func:`dump_header` function.

                                   request token or access token depending on
                                   when in the workflow it is used.
        :param resource_owner_secret: A resource owner secret obtained with
                                      either a request or access token. Often
                                      referred to as token secret.
        :param callback_uri: The URL the user is redirect back to after
                             authorization.
        :param signature_method: Signature methods determine how the OAuth
                                 signature is created. The three options are
                                 oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_HMAC (default),
                                 oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_RSA and
                                 oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_PLAIN.
        :param signature_type: Signature type decides where the OAuth
                               parameters are added. Either in the
                               Authorization header (default) or to the URL
                               query parameters or the request body. Defined as
                               oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_TYPE_AUTH_HEADER,
                               oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_TYPE_QUERY and

                        signature_method=oauthlib.oauth1.SIGNATURE_RSA.
        :param verifier: A verifier string to prove authorization was granted.
        :param client_class: A subclass of `oauthlib.oauth1.Client` to use with
                             `requests_oauthlib.OAuth1` instead of the default
        :param force_include_body: Always include the request body in the
                                   signature creation.
        :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to `OAuth1`
        aclientaoauth_tokenatoken_dictaoauth_token_secretaoauth_verifiera_populate_attributesaSIGNATURE_RSAuBoolean that indicates whether this session has an OAuth token
        or not. If `self.authorized` is True, you can reasonably expect
        OAuth-protected requests to the resource to succeed. If
        `self.authorized` is False, you need the user to go through the OAuth
        authentication dance before OAuth-protected requests to the resource
        will succeed.
        alogadebuguAdding parameters %s to url %saadd_params_to_uriaitemsuCreate an authorization URL by appending request_token and optional
        kwargs to url.

        This is the second step in the OAuth 1 workflow. The user should be
        redirected to this authorization URL, grant access to you, and then
        be redirected back to you. The redirection back can either be specified
        during client registration or by supplying a callback URI per request.

        :param url: The authorization endpoint URL.
        :param request_token: The previously obtained request token.
        :param kwargs: Optional parameters to append to the URL.
        :returns: The authorization URL with new parameters embedded.

        An example using a registered default callback URI.

        >>> request_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'
        >>> authorization_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize'

        }
        >>> oauth_session.authorization_url(authorization_url)
        'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=sdf0o9823sjdfsdf'
        >>> oauth_session.authorization_url(authorization_url, foo='bar')
        'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=sdf0o9823sjdfsdf&foo=bar'

        An example using an explicit callback URI.

        >>> request_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'
        >>> authorization_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize'

        w arealma_fetch_tokenTuResetting callback_uri and realm (not needed in next phase).uFetch a request token.

        This is the first step in the OAuth 1 workflow. A request token is
        obtained by making a signed post request to url. The token is then
        parsed from the application/x-www-form-urlencoded response and ready
        to be used to construct an authorization url.

        :param url: The request token endpoint URL.
        :param realm: A list of realms to request access to.
        :param \*\*request_kwargs: Optional arguments passed to ''post''
            function in ''requests.Session''
        :returns: The response in dict format.

        Note that a previously set callback_uri will be reset for your
        convenience, or else signature creation will be incorrect on
        consecutive requests.

        >>> request_token_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token'

        This is the final step in the OAuth 1 workflow. An access token is
        obtained using all previously obtained credentials, including the
        verifier from the authorization step.

        Note that a previously set verifier will be reset for your
        convenience, or else signature creation will be incorrect on
        consecutive requests.

    What is the difference between OAuth1Session and OAuth1?

    OAuth1Session actually uses OAuth1 internally and its purpose is to assist
    in the OAuth workflow through convenience methods to prepare authorization
    URLs and parse the various token and redirection responses. It also provide
    rudimentary validation of responses.

    An example of the OAuth workflow using a basic CLI app and Twitter.

Create new keys with the newkeys() function. It will give you a PublicKey and a
PrivateKey object.

Loading and saving keys requires the pyasn1 module. This module is imported as
late as possible, such that other functionality will remain working in absence
of pyasn1.

.. note::

    Storing public and private keys via the `pickle` module is possible.
    However, it is insecure to load a key from an untrusted source.
    The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously
    constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted
    or unauthenticated source.

    uFunctions for PKCS#1 version 1.5 encryption and signing

This module implements certain functionality from PKCS#1 version 1.5. For a
very clear example, read http://www.di-mgt.com.au/rsa_alg.html#pkcs1schemes

At least 8 bytes of random padding is used when encrypting a message. This makes
these methods much more secure than the ones in the ``rsa`` module.

WARNING: this module leaks information when decryption fails. The exceptions
that are raised contain the Python traceback information, which can be used to
deduce where in the process the failure occurred. DO NOT PASS SUCH INFORMATION
to your users.

    HTTPHeaderDict is unusual for a Mapping[str, str] in that it has two modes of
    address.

    If we directly try to get an item with a particular name, we will get a string
    back that is the concatenated version of all the values:

    >>> d['X-Header-Name']
    'Value1, Value2, Value3'

    However, if we iterate over an HTTPHeaderDict's items, we will optionally combine
    these values based on whether combine=True was called when building up the dictionary

    >>> d = HTTPHeaderDict({"A": "1", "B": "foo"})
    >>> d.add("A", "2", combine=True)
    >>> d.add("B", "bar")
    >>> list(d.items())
    [
        ('A', '1, 2'),
        ('B', 'foo'),
        ('B', 'bar'),
    ]

    This class conforms to the interface required by the MutableMapping ABC while
    also giving us the nonstandard iteration behavior we want; items with duplicate
    keys, ordered by time of first insertion.

    :param headers:
        An iterable of field-value pairs. Must not contain multiple field names
        when compared case-insensitively.

    :param kwargs:
        Additional field-value pairs to pass in to ``dict.update``.

    A ``dict`` like container for storing HTTP Headers.

    Field names are stored and compared case-insensitively in compliance with
    RFC 7230. Iteration provides the first case-sensitive key seen for each
    case-insensitive pair.

    Using ``__setitem__`` syntax overwrites fields that compare equal
    case-insensitively in order to maintain ``dict``'s api. For fields that
    compare equal, instead create a new ``HTTPHeaderDict`` and use ``.add``
    in a loop.

    If multiple fields that are equal case-insensitively are passed to the
    constructor or ``.update``, the behavior is undefined and some will be
    lost.

        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the appropriate encoding of
        ``fields`` based on the ``method`` used.

        This is a convenience method that requires the least amount of manual
        effort. It can be used in most situations, while still having the
        option to drop down to more specific methods when necessary, such as
        :meth:`request_encode_url`, :meth:`request_encode_body`,
        or even the lowest level :meth:`urlopen`.
        w?aurlencodeaurlopenu
        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the ``fields`` encoded in
        the url. This is useful for request methods like GET, HEAD, DELETE, etc.

        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the ``fields`` encoded in
        the body. This is useful for request methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.

        When ``encode_multipart=True`` (default), then
        :func:`urllib3.encode_multipart_formdata` is used to encode
        the payload with the appropriate content type. Otherwise
        :func:`urllib.parse.urlencode` is used with the
        'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content type.

        Multipart encoding must be used when posting files, and it's reasonably
        safe to use it in other times too. However, it may break request
        signing, such as with OAuth.

        Supports an optional ``fields`` parameter of key/value strings AND
        key/filetuple. A filetuple is a (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where
        the MIME type is optional. For example::

            fields = {
                'foo': 'bar',
                'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
                'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),
                'typedfile': ('bazfile.bin', open('bazfile').read(),
                              'image/jpeg'),
                'nonamefile': 'contents of nonamefile field',
            }

        When uploading a file, providing a filename (the first parameter of the
        tuple) is optional but recommended to best mimic behavior of browsers.

        Note that if ``headers`` are supplied, the 'Content-Type' header will
        be overwritten because it depends on the dynamic random boundary string
        which is used to compose the body of the request. The random boundary
        string can be explicitly set with the ``multipart_boundary`` parameter.

    Convenience mixin for classes who implement a :meth:`urlopen` method, such
    as :class:`urllib3.HTTPConnectionPool` and
    :class:`urllib3.PoolManager`.

    Provides behavior for making common types of HTTP request methods and
    decides which type of request field encoding to use.

    Specifically,

    :meth:`.request_encode_url` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the URL (such as GET, HEAD, DELETE).

    :meth:`.request_encode_body` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the *body* of the request using multipart or www-form-urlencoded
    (such as for POST, PUT, PATCH).

    :meth:`.request` is for making any kind of request, it will look up the
    appropriate encoding format and use one of the above two methods to make
    the request.

    Initializer parameters:

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given

        Getter method to remove any trailing dots that indicate the hostname is an FQDN.

        In general, SSL certificates don't include the trailing dot indicating a
        fully-qualified domain name, and thus, they don't validate properly when
        checked against a domain name that includes the dot. In addition, some
        servers may not expect to receive the trailing dot when provided.

        However, the hostname with trailing dot is critical to DNS resolution; doing a
        lookup with the trailing dot will properly only resolve the appropriate FQDN,
        whereas a lookup without a trailing dot will search the system's search domain
        list. Thus, it's important to keep the original host around for use only in
        those cases where it's appropriate (i.e., when doing DNS lookup to establish the
        actual TCP connection across which we're going to send HTTP requests).
        u
        Setter for the `host` property.

        We assume that only urllib3 uses the _dns_host attribute; httplib itself
        only uses `host`, and it seems reasonable that other libraries follow suit.

    Based on :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection` but provides an extra constructor
    backwards-compatibility layer between older and newer Pythons.

    Additional keyword parameters are used to configure attributes of the connection.
    Accepted parameters include:

    - ``source_address``: Set the source address for the current connection.
    - ``socket_options``: Set specific options on the underlying socket. If not specified, then
      defaults are loaded from ``HTTPConnection.default_socket_options`` which includes disabling
      Nagle's algorithm (sets TCP_NODELAY to 1) unless the connection is behind a proxy.

      For example, if you wish to enable TCP Keep Alive in addition to the defaults,
      you might pass:

      .. code-block:: python

         HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
             (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),
         ]

      Or you may want to disable the defaults by passing an empty list (e.g., ``[]``).

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param response_conn:
            Set this to ``None`` if you will handle releasing the connection or
            set the connection to have the response release it.

        :param preload_content:
          If True, the response's body will be preloaded during construction.

        :param decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param enforce_content_length:
            Enforce content length checking. Body returned by server must match
            value of Content-Length header, if present. Otherwise, raise error.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.

        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.

        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or

    Given a url, return an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance of its host.

    This is a shortcut for not having to parse out the scheme, host, and port
    of the url before creating an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance.

    :param url:
        Absolute URL string that must include the scheme. Port is optional.

    :param \**kw:
        Passes additional parameters to the constructor of the appropriate
        :class:`.ConnectionPool`. Useful for specifying things like
        timeout, maxsize, headers, etc.

    Example::

        >>> conn = connection_from_url('http://google.com/')
        >>> r = conn.request('GET', '/')

    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.

    Same as :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool`, but HTTPS.

    :class:`.HTTPSConnection` uses one of ``assert_fingerprint``,
    ``assert_hostname`` and ``host`` in this order to verify connections.
    If ``assert_hostname`` is False, no verification is done.

    The ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, ``cert_reqs``, ``ca_certs``,
    ``ca_cert_dir``, ``ssl_version``, ``key_password`` are only used if :mod:`ssl`
    is available and are fed into :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket` to upgrade
    the connection socket into an SSL socket.

        Borrowed wholesale from the Python Cryptography Project. It turns out

    Converts a dNSName SubjectAlternativeName field to the form used by the
    standard library on the given Python version.

    Cryptography produces a dNSName as a unicode string that was idna-decoded
    from ASCII bytes. We need to idna-encode that string to get it back, and
    then on Python 3 we also need to convert to unicode via UTF-8 (the stdlib
    uses PyUnicode_FromStringAndSize on it, which decodes via UTF-8).

    If the name cannot be idna-encoded then we return None signalling that
    the name given should be skipped.

Module for using pyOpenSSL as a TLS backend. This module was relevant before
the standard library ``ssl`` module supported SNI, but now that we've dropped
support for Python 2.7 all relevant Python versions support SNI so
**this module is no longer recommended**.

This needs the following packages installed:

* `pyOpenSSL`_ (tested with 16.0.0)
* `cryptography`_ (minimum 1.3.4, from pyopenssl)
* `idna`_ (minimum 2.0)

However, pyOpenSSL depends on cryptography, so while we use all three directly here we
end up having relatively few packages required.

You can install them with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install pyopenssl cryptography idna

To activate certificate checking, call
:func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3` from your Python code
before you begin making HTTP requests. This can be done in a ``sitecustomize``
module, or at any other time before your application begins using ``urllib3``,
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
        urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
    except ImportError:
        pass

This module contains provisional support for SOCKS proxies from within
urllib3. This module supports SOCKS4, SOCKS4A (an extension of SOCKS4), and
SOCKS5. To enable its functionality, either install PySocks or install this
module with the ``socks`` extra.

The SOCKS implementation supports the full range of urllib3 features. It also
supports the following SOCKS features:

- SOCKS4A (``proxy_url='socks4a://...``)
- SOCKS4 (``proxy_url='socks4://...``)
- SOCKS5 with remote DNS (``proxy_url='socks5h://...``)
- SOCKS5 with local DNS (``proxy_url='socks5://...``)
- Usernames and passwords for the SOCKS proxy

.. note::
   It is recommended to use ``socks5h://`` or ``socks4a://`` schemes in
   your ``proxy_url`` to ensure that DNS resolution is done from the remote
   server instead of client-side when connecting to a domain name.

SOCKS4 supports IPv4 and domain names with the SOCKS4A extension. SOCKS5
supports IPv4, IPv6, and domain names.

When connecting to a SOCKS4 proxy the ``username`` portion of the ``proxy_url``
will be sent as the ``userid`` section of the SOCKS request:

.. code-block:: python

    proxy_url="socks4a://<userid>@proxy-host"

When connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy the ``username`` and ``password`` portion
of the ``proxy_url`` will be sent as the username/password to authenticate
with the proxy:

.. code-block:: python

    proxy_url="socks5h://<username>:<password>@proxy-host"

        Supports constructing :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField` from
        parameter of key/value strings AND key/filetuple. A filetuple is a
        (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where the MIME type is optional.
        For example::

            'foo': 'bar',
            'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
            'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),

    Create a pool key out of a request context dictionary.

    According to RFC 3986, both the scheme and host are case-insensitive.

    Behaves just like :class:`PoolManager`, but sends all requests through
    the defined proxy, using the CONNECT method for HTTPS URLs.

    :param proxy_url:
        The URL of the proxy to be used.

    :param proxy_headers:
        A dictionary containing headers that will be sent to the proxy. In case
        of HTTP they are being sent with each request, while in the
        HTTPS/CONNECT case they are sent only once. Could be used for proxy
        authentication.

    :param proxy_ssl_context:
        The proxy SSL context is used to establish the TLS connection to the
        proxy when using HTTPS proxies.

    :param use_forwarding_for_https:
        (Defaults to False) If set to True will forward requests to the HTTPS
        proxy to be made on behalf of the client instead of creating a TLS
        tunnel via the CONNECT method. **Enabling this flag means that request
        and response headers and content will be visible from the HTTPS proxy**
        whereas tunneling keeps request and response headers and content
        private.  IP address, target hostname, SNI, and port are always visible
        to an HTTPS proxy even when this flag is disabled.

    :param proxy_assert_hostname:
        The hostname of the certificate to verify against.

    :param proxy_assert_fingerprint:
        The fingerprint of the certificate to verify against.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        import urllib3

        proxy = urllib3.ProxyManager("https://localhost:3128/")

        resp1 = proxy.request("GET", "https://google.com/")
        resp2 = proxy.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/")

        print(len(proxy.pools))
        # 1

        resp3 = proxy.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/")
        resp4 = proxy.request("GET", "https://twitter.com/")

        print(len(proxy.pools))

        Similar to :meth:`http.client.HTTPResponse.read`, but with two additional

            How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped
            because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full
            response.

            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param cache_content:
            If True, will save the returned data such that the same result is
            returned despite of the state of the underlying file object. This
            is useful if you want the ``.data`` property to continue working
            after having ``.read()`` the file object. (Overridden if ``amt`` is
            set.)

        A generator wrapper for the read() method. A call will block until

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. The generator will return up to
            much data per iteration, but may return less. This is particularly
            likely when using compressed data. However, the empty string will
            never be returned.

    To return decoded data in read() and still follow the BufferedIOBase API, we need a
    buffer to always return the correct amount of bytes.

    This buffer should be filled using calls to put()

    Our maximum memory usage is determined by the sum of the size of:

     * self.buffer, which contains the full data
     * the largest chunk that we will copy in get()

    The worst case scenario is a single chunk, in which case we'll make a full copy of
    the data inside get().

    HTTP Response container.

    Backwards-compatible with :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse` but the response ``body`` is
    loaded and decoded on-demand when the ``data`` property is accessed.  This
    class is also compatible with the Python standard library's :mod:`io`
    module, and can hence be treated as a readable object in the context of that
    framework.

    Extra parameters for behaviour not present in :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse`:

    :param preload_content:
        If True, the response's body will be preloaded during construction.

    :param decode_content:
        If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
        'content-encoding' header.

    :param original_response:
        When this HTTPResponse wrapper is generated from an :class:`http.client.HTTPResponse`
        object, it's convenient to include the original for debug purposes. It's
        otherwise unused.

    :param retries:
        The retries contains the last :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` that
        was used during the request.

    :param enforce_content_length:
        Enforce content length checking. Body returned by server must match
        value of Content-Length header, if present. Otherwise, raise error.

    Each retry attempt will create a new Retry object with updated values, so
    they can be safely reused.

    Retries can be defined as a default for a pool:

    .. code-block:: python

        retries = Retry(connect=5, read=2, redirect=5)
        http = PoolManager(retries=retries)
        response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/")

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool):

    .. code-block:: python

        response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", retries=Retry(10))

    Retries can be disabled by passing ``False``:

    .. code-block:: python

        response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", retries=False)

    Errors will be wrapped in :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` unless
    retries are disabled, in which case the causing exception will be raised.

    :param int total:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

        Set to ``None`` to remove this constraint and fall back on other
        counts.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int connect:
        How many connection-related errors to retry on.

        These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,
        which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int read:
        How many times to retry on read errors.

        These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the
        request may have side-effects.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int redirect:
        How many redirects to perform. Limit this to avoid infinite redirect
        loops.

        A redirect is a HTTP response with a status code 301, 302, 303, 307 or
        308.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int status:
        How many times to retry on bad status codes.

        These are retries made on responses, where status code matches
        ``status_forcelist``.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int other:
        How many times to retry on other errors.

        Other errors are errors that are not connect, read, redirect or status errors.
        These errors might be raised after the request was sent to the server, so the
        request might have side-effects.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

        If ``total`` is not set, it's a good idea to set this to 0 to account
        for unexpected edge cases and avoid infinite retry loops.

    :param Collection allowed_methods:
        Set of uppercased HTTP method verbs that we should retry on.

        By default, we only retry on methods which are considered to be
        idempotent (multiple requests with the same parameters end with the
        same state). See :attr:`Retry.DEFAULT_ALLOWED_METHODS`.

        Set to a ``None`` value to retry on any verb.

    :param Collection status_forcelist:
        A set of integer HTTP status codes that we should force a retry on.
        A retry is initiated if the request method is in ``allowed_methods``
        and the response status code is in ``status_forcelist``.

        By default, this is disabled with ``None``.

    :param float backoff_factor:
        A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try
        (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a
        delay). urllib3 will sleep for::

            {backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of previous retries}))

        seconds. If `backoff_jitter` is non-zero, this sleep is extended by::

            random.uniform(0, {backoff jitter})

        seconds. For example, if the backoff_factor is 0.1, then :func:`Retry.sleep` will
        sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.8s, ...] between retries. No backoff will ever
        be longer than `backoff_max`.

        By default, backoff is disabled (factor set to 0).

    :param bool raise_on_redirect: Whether, if the number of redirects is
        exhausted, to raise a MaxRetryError, or to return a response with a
        response code in the 3xx range.

    :param bool raise_on_status: Similar meaning to ``raise_on_redirect``:
        whether we should raise an exception, or return a response,
        if status falls in ``status_forcelist`` range and retries have
        been exhausted.

    :param tuple history: The history of the request encountered during
        each call to :meth:`~Retry.increment`. The list is in the order
        the requests occurred. Each list item is of class :class:`RequestHistory`.

    :param bool respect_retry_after_header:
        Whether to respect Retry-After header on status codes defined as
        :attr:`Retry.RETRY_AFTER_STATUS_CODES` or not.

    :param Collection remove_headers_on_redirect:
        Sequence of headers to remove from the request when a response
        indicating a redirect is returned before firing off the redirected
        request.

    The SSLTransport wraps an existing socket and establishes an SSL connection.

    Contrary to Python's implementation of SSLSocket, it allows you to chain
    multiple TLS connections together. It's particularly useful if you need to
    implement TLS within TLS.

    The class supports most of the socket API operations.

    Timeouts can be defined as a default for a pool:

    .. code-block:: python

        import urllib3

        timeout = urllib3.util.Timeout(connect=2.0, read=7.0)

        http = urllib3.PoolManager(timeout=timeout)

        resp = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/")

        print(resp.status)

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool):

    .. code-block:: python

       response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", timeout=Timeout(10))

    Timeouts can be disabled by setting all the parameters to ``None``:

    .. code-block:: python

       no_timeout = Timeout(connect=None, read=None)
       response = http.request("GET", "https://example.com/", timeout=no_timeout)


    :param total:
        This combines the connect and read timeouts into one; the read timeout
        will be set to the time leftover from the connect attempt. In the
        event that both a connect timeout and a total are specified, or a read
        timeout and a total are specified, the shorter timeout will be applied.

        Defaults to None.

    :type total: int, float, or None

    :param connect:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection
        attempt to a server to succeed. Omitting the parameter will default the
        connect timeout to the system default, probably `the global default
        timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout for connection attempts.

    :type connect: int, float, or None

    :param read:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait between consecutive
        read operations for a response from the server. Omitting the parameter
        will default the read timeout to the system default, probably `the
        global default timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout.

    :type read: int, float, or None

    .. note::

        Many factors can affect the total amount of time for urllib3 to return
        an HTTP response.

        For example, Python's DNS resolver does not obey the timeout specified
        on the socket. Other factors that can affect total request time include
        high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a low priority level,
        or other behaviors.

        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between
        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,
        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete
        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server
        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always
        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout
        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take
        several minutes to complete.

        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock
        time, consider having a second "watcher" thread to cut off a slow
        request.

    This function allows a CLSID to be globally associated with a class.
    Certain module will automatically convert an IDispatch object to an
    instance of the associated class.
    aupdateuRegister a dictionary of CLSID's and classes.

    This module performs the same function as @RegisterCLSID@, but for
    an entire dictionary of associations.

    Typically called by makepy generated modules at import time.
    uGiven a CLSID, return the globally associated class.

    clsid -- a string CLSID representation to check.
    uDetermines if the CLSID has an associated class.

    clsid -- the string CLSID to check
    uManages a dictionary of CLSID strings to Python classes.

Primary use of this module is to allow modules generated by
makepy.py to share classes.  @makepy@ automatically generates code
which interacts with this module.  You should never need to reference
this module directly.

This module only provides support for modules which have been previously
been imported.  The gencache module provides some support for loading modules
on demand - once done, this module supports it...

As an example, the MSACCESS.TLB type library makes reference to the
CLSID of the Database object, as defined in DAO3032.DLL.  This
allows code using the MSAccess wrapper to natively use Databases.

This obviously applies to all cooperating objects, not just DAO and
Access.

    clsid -- The ProgID or CLSID of the object to create.
    user_event_class -- A Python class object that responds to the events.

    This requires makepy support for the COM object being created.  If
    this support does not exist it will be automatically generated by
    this function.  If the object does not support makepy, a TypeError
    exception will be raised.

    The result is a class instance that both represents the COM object
    and handles events from the COM object.

    It is important to note that the returned instance is not a direct
    instance of the user_event_class, but an instance of a temporary
    class object that derives from three classes:
    * The makepy generated class for the COM object
    * The makepy generated class for the COM events
    * The user_event_class as passed to this function.

    If this is not suitable, see the getevents function for an alternative
    technique of handling events.

    Object Lifetimes:  Whenever the object returned from this function is
    cleaned-up by Python, the events will be disconnected from
    the COM object.  This is almost always what should happen,
    but see the documentation for getevents() for more details.

    Example:

    >>> class IEEvents:
    ...    def OnVisible(self, visible):
    ...       print "Visible changed:", visible
    ...
    >>> ie = DispatchWithEvents("InternetExplorer.Application", IEEvents)
    >>> ie.Visible = 1
    Visible changed: 1
    >>>
    ainstanceuSimilar to DispatchWithEvents - except that the returned
    object is *not* also usable as the original Dispatch object - that is
    the returned object is not dispatchable.

    The difference is best summarised by example.

    >>> class IEEvents:
    ...    def OnVisible(self, visible):
    ...       print "Visible changed:", visible
    ...
    >>> ie = Dispatch("InternetExplorer.Application")
    >>> ie_events = WithEvents(ie, IEEvents)
    >>> ie.Visible = 1
    Visible changed: 1

    Compare with the code sample for DispatchWithEvents, where you get a
    single object that is both the interface and the event handler.  Note that
    the event handler instance will *not* be able to use 'self.' to refer to
    IE's methods and properties.

    This is mainly useful where using DispatchWithEvents causes
    circular reference problems that the simple proxy doesn't deal with
    adefault_sourceacoclass_clsiduDetermine the default outgoing interface for a class, given
    either a clsid or progid. It returns a class - you can
    conveniently derive your own handler from this class and implement
    the appropriate methods.

    This method relies on the classes produced by makepy. You must use
    either makepy or the gencache module to ensure that the
    appropriate support classes have been generated for the com server
    that you will be handling events from.

    Beware of COM circular references.  When the Events class is connected
    to the COM object, the COM object itself keeps a reference to the Python
    events class.  Thus, neither the Events instance or the COM object will
    ever die by themselves.  The 'close' method on the events instance
    must be called to break this chain and allow standard Python collection
    rules to manage object lifetimes.  Note that DispatchWithEvents() does
    work around this problem by the use of a proxy object, but if you use
    the getevents() function yourself, you must make your own arrangements
    to manage this circular reference issue.

    Beware of creating Python circular references: this will happen if your
    handler has a reference to an object that has a reference back to
    the event source. Call the 'close' method to break the chain.

    Example:

    >>>win32com.client.gencache.EnsureModule('{EAB22AC0-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}',0,1,1)
    <module 'win32com.gen_py.....
    >>>
    >>> class InternetExplorerEvents(win32com.client.getevents("InternetExplorer.Application.1")):
    ...    def OnVisible(self, Visible):
    ...        print "Visibility changed: ", Visible
    ...
    >>>
    >>> ie=win32com.client.Dispatch("InternetExplorer.Application.1")
    >>> events=InternetExplorerEvents(ie)
    >>> ie.Visible=1
    Visibility changed:  1

Introduction
 Dynamic COM client support is the ability to use a COM server without
 prior knowledge of the server.  This can be used to talk to almost all
 COM servers, including much of MS Office.

 In general, you should not use this module directly - see below.

Example
 >>> import win32com.client
 >>> xl = win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
 # The line above invokes the functionality of this class.
 # xl is now an object we can use to talk to Excel.
 >>> xl.Visible = 1 # The Excel window becomes visible.

aexitTluManages the cache of generated Python code.

Description
  This file manages the cache of generated Python code.  When run from the
  command line, it also provides a number of options for managing that cache.

Implementation
  Each typelib is generated into a filename of format "{guid}x{lcid}x{major}x{minor}.py"

  An external persistant dictionary maps from all known IIDs in all known type libraries
  to the type library itself.

  Thus, whenever Python code knows the IID of an object, it can find the IID, LCID and version of
  the type library which supports it.  Given this information, it can find the Python module
  with the support.

  If necessary, this support can be generated on the fly.

Hacks, to do, etc
  Currently just uses a pickled dictionary, but should used some sort of indexed file.
  Maybe an OLE2 compound file, or a bsddb file?

This code was moved simply to speed Python in normal circumstances.  As the makepy.py
is normally run from the command line, it reparses the code each time.  Now makepy
is nothing more than the command line handler and public interface.

The makepy command line etc handling is also getting large enough in its own right!

 This module is concerned only with the actual writing of
 a .py file.  It draws on the @build@ module, which builds
 the knowledge of a COM interface.

a__doc__a__file__a__spec__aoriginahas_locationa__cached__u
Usage:

  makepy.py [-i] [-v|q] [-h] [-u] [-o output_file] [-d] [typelib, ...]

  -i    -- Show information for the specified typelib.

  -v    -- Verbose output.

  -q    -- Quiet output.

  -h    -- Do not generate hidden methods.

  -u    -- Python 1.5 and earlier: Do NOT convert all Unicode objects to
           strings.

           Python 1.6 and later: Convert all Unicode objects to strings.

  -o    -- Create output in a specified output file.  If the path leading
           to the file does not exist, any missing directories will be
           created.
           NOTE: -o cannot be used with -d.  This will generate an error.

  -d    -- Generate the base code now and the class code on demand.
           Recommended for large type libraries.

  typelib -- A TLB, DLL, OCX or anything containing COM type information.
             If a typelib is not specified, a window containing a textbox
             will open from which you can select a registered type
             library.

Examples:

  makepy.py -d

    Presents a list of registered type libraries from which you can make
    a selection.

  makepy.py -d "Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library"

    Generate support for the type library with the specified description
    (in this case, the MS Excel object model).

    By wrapping a PyIEnum* object in this class, you can perform
    natural looping and indexing into the Enumerator.

    Looping is very efficient, but it should be noted that although random
    access is supported, the underlying object is still an enumerator, so
    this will force many reset-and-seek operations to find the requested index.

            c = wmi.WMI()

            for i in pp.associators(wmi_association_class="Win32_PortResource"):

        aSpawnInstance_uThis is the equivalent to the raw-WMI SpawnInstance\_
        method. Note that there are relatively few uses for
        this, certainly fewer than you might imagine. Most
        classes which need to create a new *real* instance
        of themselves, eg Win32_Process, offer a .Create
        method. SpawnInstance\_ is generally reserved for
        instances which are passed as parameters to such
        `.Create` methods, a common example being the
        `Win32_SecurityDescriptor`, passed to `Win32_Share.Create`
        and other instances which need security.

        The example here is `Win32_ProcessStartup`, which
        controls the shown/hidden state etc. of a new
        `Win32_Process` instance::

            import win32con
            import wmi
            c = wmi.WMI()
            startup = c.Win32_ProcessStartup.new(ShowWindow=win32con.SW_SHOWMINIMIZED)
            pid, retval = c.Win32_Process.Create(
                CommandLine="notepad.exe",
                ProcessStartupInformation=startup
            )

    For complete control, a named argument "wmi" can be supplied, which

        svc = loc.ConnectServer(...)

    This is the only way of connecting to a remote computer with a different

    name.

    uThis function can be implemented using wmi.WMI(namespace='DEFAULT').StdRegProvadefaultaStdRegProvuWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's answer to
the DMTF's Common Information Model. It allows you to query just
about any conceivable piece of information from any computer which
is running the necessary agent and over which have you the
necessary authority.

Since the COM implementation doesn't give much away to Python
programmers, I've wrapped it in some lightweight classes with
some getattr / setattr magic to ease the way. In particular:

*   The :class:`_wmi_namespace` object itself will determine its classes
    and allow you to return all instances of any of them by
    using its name as an attribute::

        disks = wmi.WMI().Win32_LogicalDisk()

*   In addition, you can specify what would become the WHERE clause
    as keyword parameters::

        fixed_disks = wmi.WMI().Win32_LogicalDisk(DriveType=3)

*   The objects returned by a WMI lookup are wrapped in a Python
    class which determines their methods and classes and allows
    you to access them as though they were Python classes. The
    methods only allow named parameters::

        for p in wmi.WMI().Win32_Process(Name="notepad.exe"):
            p.Terminate(Result=1)

*   Doing a print on one of the WMI objects will result in its
    `GetObjectText\_` method being called, which usually produces
    a meaningful printout of current values.
    The repr of the object will include its full WMI path,
    which lets you get directly to it if you need to.

*   You can get the associators and references of an object as
    a list of python objects by calling the associators() and
    references() methods on a WMI Python object::

        for p in wmi.WMI().Win32_Process(Name="notepad.exe"):
            for r in p.references():
                print(r)

    ..    note::
            Don't do this on a Win32_ComputerSystem object; it will
            take all day and kill your machine!


*   WMI classes (as opposed to instances) are first-class
    objects, so you can get hold of a class, and call
    its methods or set up a watch against it::

        process = wmi.WMI().Win32_Process
        process.Create(CommandLine="notepad.exe")

*   To make it easier to use in embedded systems and py2exe-style
    executable wrappers, the module will not force early Dispatch.
    To do this, it uses a handy hack by Thomas Heller for easy access
    to constants.

Typical usage will be::

    import wmi

    vodev1 = wmi.WMI("vodev1")
    for disk in vodev1.Win32_LogicalDisk():
        if disk.DriveType == 3:
            space = 100 * long(disk.FreeSpace) / long(disk.Size)
            print("%s has %d%% free" %(disk.Name, space))

Many thanks, obviously to Mark Hammond for creating the win32all
extensions, but also to Alex Martelli and Roger Upole, whose
c.l.py postings pointed me in the right direction.
Thanks especially in release 1.2 to Paul Tiemann for his code
contributions and robust testing.

        ``zstandard.COMPRESSOBJ_FLUSH_FINISH`` (the default) ends the

        is performed, ``compress()`` and ``flush()`` can no longer be called.
        This type of flush **must** be called to end the compression context. If

        by a decompressor.

        ``zstandard.COMPRESSOBJ_FLUSH_BLOCK`` will flush a zstd block. This

        This is the simplest mechanism to perform compression: simply pass in a

        abuse.

        The input and output values must fit in memory, so passing in very large

        Data will be read from ``ifh``, compressed, and written to ``ofh``.
        ``ifh`` must have a ``read(size)`` method. ``ofh`` must have a
        ``write(data)``
        method.

        >>> with open(input_path, "rb") as ifh, open(output_path, "wb") as ofh:
        ...     cctx.copy_stream(ifh, ofh)

        It is also possible to declare the size of the source stream:

        >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        >>> cctx.copy_stream(ifh, ofh, size=len_of_input)

        You can also specify how large the chunks that are ``read()``
        and ``write()`` from and to the streams:

        >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        >>> cctx.copy_stream(ifh, ofh, read_size=32768, write_size=16384)

        The stream copier returns a 2-tuple of bytes read and written:

        This will produce an object conforming to the ``io.RawIOBase``
        interface which can be ``read()`` from to retrieve compressed data
        from a source.

        The source object can be any object with a ``read(size)`` method
        or an object that conforms to the buffer protocol.

        As compressed data is available, ``write()`` will be called with the
        compressed data as its argument. Many common Python types implement
        ``write()``, including open file handles and ``io.BytesIO``.

        u
        Read uncompressed data from a reader and return an iterator

        Returns an iterator of compressed data produced from reading from
        ``reader``.

        This method provides a mechanism to stream compressed data out of a
        source as an iterator of data chunks.

        Uncompressed data will be obtained from ``reader`` by calling the
        ``read(size)`` method of it or by reading a slice (if ``reader``
        conforms to the *buffer protocol*). The source data will be streamed
        into a compressor. As compressed data is available, it will be exposed
        to the iterator.

        Data is read from the source in chunks of ``read_size``. Compressed
        chunks are at most ``write_size`` bytes. Both values default to the
        zstd input and and output defaults, respectively.

        If reading from the source via ``read()``, ``read()`` will be called
        until it raises or returns an empty bytes (``b""``). It is perfectly
        valid for the source to deliver fewer bytes than were what requested
        by ``read(size)``.

        The caller is partially in control of how fast data is fed into the
        compressor by how it consumes the returned iterator. The compressor
        will not consume from the reader unless the caller consumes from the
        iterator.

        >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        >>> for chunk in cctx.read_to_iter(fh):
        ...     # Do something with emitted data.

        ``read_to_iter()`` accepts a ``size`` argument declaring the size of
        the input stream:

        >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        >>> for chunk in cctx.read_to_iter(fh, size=some_int):
        >>>     pass

        You can also control the size that data is ``read()`` from the source
        and the ideal size of output chunks:

        >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        >>> for chunk in cctx.read_to_iter(fh, read_size=16384, write_size=8192):
        >>>     pass

        ``read_to_iter()`` does not give direct control over the sizes of chunks
        fed into the compressor. Instead, chunk sizes will be whatever the object
        being read from delivers. These will often be of a uniform size.

        Compress multiple pieces of data as a single function call.

        (Experimental. Not yet supported by CFFI backend.)

        This function is optimized to perform multiple compression operations
        as as possible with as little overhead as possible.

        Data to be compressed can be passed as a ``BufferWithSegmentsCollection``,
        a ``BufferWithSegments``, or a list containing byte like objects. Each
        element of the container will be compressed individually using the
        configured parameters on the ``ZstdCompressor`` instance.

        The ``threads`` argument controls how many threads to use for
        compression. The default is ``0`` which means to use a single thread.
        Negative values use the number of logical CPUs in the machine.

        The function returns a ``BufferWithSegmentsCollection``. This type
        represents N discrete memory allocations, each holding 1 or more
        compressed frames.

        Output data is written to shared memory buffers. This means that unlike
        regular Python objects, a reference to *any* object within the collection
        keeps the shared buffer and therefore memory backing it alive. This can
        have undesirable effects on process memory usage.

        The API and behavior of this function is experimental and will likely
        change. Known deficiencies include:

        * If asked to use multiple threads, it will always spawn that many
          threads, even if the input is too small to use them. It should
          automatically lower the thread count when the extra threads would
          just add overhead.
        * The buffer allocation strategy is fixed. There is room to make it
          dynamic, perhaps even to allow one output buffer per input,
          facilitating a variation of the API to return a list without the
          adverse effects of shared memory buffers.

        :param data:
           Source to read discrete pieces of data to compress.

    A compression dictionary of size ``dict_size`` will be created from the
    iterable of ``samples``. The raw dictionary bytes will be returned.

    The dictionary training mechanism is known as *cover*. More details about it
    are available in the paper *Effective Construction of Relative Lempel-Ziv
    Dictionaries* (authors: Liao, Petri, Moffat, Wirth).

    The cover algorithm takes parameters ``k`` and ``d``. These are the
    *segment size* and *dmer size*, respectively. The returned dictionary
    instance created by this function has ``k`` and ``d`` attributes
    containing the values for these parameters. If a ``ZstdCompressionDict``
    is constructed from raw bytes data (a content-only dictionary), the
    ``k`` and ``d`` attributes will be ``0``.

    The segment and dmer size parameters to the cover algorithm can either be
    specified manually or ``train_dictionary()`` can try multiple values
    and pick the best one, where *best* means the smallest compressed data size.
    This later mode is called *optimization* mode.

    Under the hood, this function always calls
    ``ZDICT_optimizeTrainFromBuffer_fastCover()``. See the corresponding C library
    documentation for more.

    If neither ``steps`` nor ``threads`` is defined, defaults for ``d``, ``steps``,
    and ``level`` will be used that are equivalent with what
    ``ZDICT_trainFromBuffer()`` would use.

        Decompress data in a single operation.

        This method will decompress the input data in a single operation and
        return the decompressed data.

        The input bytes are expected to contain at least 1 full Zstandard frame
        (something compressed with :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.compress` or
        similar). If the input does not contain a full frame, an exception will
        be raised.

        ``read_across_frames`` controls whether to read multiple zstandard
        frames in the input. When False, decompression stops after reading the
        first frame. This feature is not yet implemented but the argument is
        provided for forward API compatibility when the default is changed to
        True in a future release. For now, if you need to decompress multiple
        frames, use an API like :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_reader` with
        ``read_across_frames=True``.

        ``allow_extra_data`` controls how to handle extra input data after a
        fully decoded frame. If False, any extra data (which could be a valid
        zstd frame) will result in ``ZstdError`` being raised. If True, extra
        data is silently ignored. The default will likely change to False in a
        future release when ``read_across_frames`` defaults to True.

        If the input contains extra data after a full frame, that extra input
        data is silently ignored. This behavior is undesirable in many scenarios
        and will likely be changed or controllable in a future release (see
        #181).

        If the frame header of the compressed data does not contain the content
        size, ``max_output_size`` must be specified or ``ZstdError`` will be
        raised. An allocation of size ``max_output_size`` will be performed and an
        attempt will be made to perform decompression into that buffer. If the
        buffer is too small or cannot be allocated, ``ZstdError`` will be
        raised. The buffer will be resized if it is too large.

        Uncompressed data could be much larger than compressed data. As a result,
        calling this function could result in a very large memory allocation
        being performed to hold the uncompressed data. This could potentially
        result in ``MemoryError`` or system memory swapping. If you don't need
        the full output data in a single contiguous array in memory, consider
        using streaming decompression for more resilient memory behavior.

        Usage:

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> decompressed = dctx.decompress(data)

        If the compressed data doesn't have its content size embedded within it,
        decompression can be attempted by specifying the ``max_output_size``
        argument:

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> uncompressed = dctx.decompress(data, max_output_size=1048576)

        Ideally, ``max_output_size`` will be identical to the decompressed
        output size.

        .. important::

           If the exact size of decompressed data is unknown (not passed in
           explicitly and not stored in the zstd frame), for performance
           reasons it is encouraged to use a streaming API.

        :param max_output_size:

        uRead compressed data to an iterator of uncompressed chunks.

        This method will read data from ``reader``, feed it to a decompressor,
        and emit ``bytes`` chunks representing the decompressed result.

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> for chunk in dctx.read_to_iter(fh):
        ...     # Do something with original data.

        ``read_to_iter()`` accepts an object with a ``read(size)`` method that
        will return compressed bytes or an object conforming to the buffer
        protocol.

        ``read_to_iter()`` returns an iterator whose elements are chunks of the
        decompressed data.

        The size of requested ``read()`` from the source can be specified:

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> for chunk in dctx.read_to_iter(fh, read_size=16384):
        ...    pass

        It is also possible to skip leading bytes in the input data:

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> for chunk in dctx.read_to_iter(fh, skip_bytes=1):
        ...    pass

        .. tip::

           Skipping leading bytes is useful if the source data contains extra
           *header* data. Traditionally, you would need to create a slice or
           ``memoryview`` of the data you want to decompress. This would create
           overhead. It is more efficient to pass the offset into this API.

        Similarly to :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.read_to_iter`, the consumer of the
        iterator controls when data is decompressed. If the iterator isn't consumed,
        decompression is put on hold.

        When ``read_to_iter()`` is passed an object conforming to the buffer protocol,
        the behavior may seem similar to what occurs when the simple decompression
        API is used. However, this API works when the decompressed size is unknown.
        Furthermore, if feeding large inputs, the decompressor will work in chunks
        instead of performing a single operation.

        :param reader:
           Source of compressed data. Can be any object with a

        Decompress a series of frames using the content dictionary chaining technique.

        Such a list of frames is produced by compressing discrete inputs where
        each non-initial input is compressed with a *prefix* dictionary consisting
        of the content of the previous input.

        For example, say you have the following inputs:

        >>> inputs = [b"input 1", b"input 2", b"input 3"]

        The zstd frame chain consists of:

        1. ``b"input 1"`` compressed in standalone/discrete mode
        2. ``b"input 2"`` compressed using ``b"input 1"`` as a *prefix* dictionary
        3. ``b"input 3"`` compressed using ``b"input 2"`` as a *prefix* dictionary

        Each zstd frame **must** have the content size written.

        The following Python code can be used to produce a *prefix dictionary chain*:

        >>> def make_chain(inputs):
        ...    frames = []
        ...
        ...    # First frame is compressed in standalone/discrete mode.
        ...    zctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
        ...    frames.append(zctx.compress(inputs[0]))
        ...
        ...    # Subsequent frames use the previous fulltext as a prefix dictionary
        ...    for i, raw in enumerate(inputs[1:]):
        ...        dict_data = zstandard.ZstdCompressionDict(
        ...            inputs[i], dict_type=zstandard.DICT_TYPE_RAWCONTENT)
        ...        zctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor(dict_data=dict_data)
        ...        frames.append(zctx.compress(raw))
        ...
        ...    return frames

        ``decompress_content_dict_chain()`` returns the uncompressed data of the last
        element in the input chain.

        .. note::

           It is possible to implement *prefix dictionary chain* decompression
           on top of other APIs. However, this function will likely be faster -
           especially for long input chains - as it avoids the overhead of
           instantiating and passing around intermediate objects between
           multiple functions.

        :param frames:
           List of ``bytes`` holding compressed zstd frames.
        :return:
        u
        Decompress multiple zstd frames to output buffers as a single operation.

        (Experimental. Not available in CFFI backend.)

        Compressed frames can be passed to the function as a
        ``BufferWithSegments``, a ``BufferWithSegmentsCollection``, or as a
        list containing objects that conform to the buffer protocol. For best
        performance, pass a ``BufferWithSegmentsCollection`` or a
        ``BufferWithSegments``, as minimal input validation will be done for
        that type. If calling from Python (as opposed to C), constructing one
        of these instances may add overhead cancelling out the performance
        overhead of validation for list inputs.

        Returns a ``BufferWithSegmentsCollection`` containing the decompressed
        data. All decompressed data is allocated in a single memory buffer. The
        ``BufferWithSegments`` instance tracks which objects are at which offsets
        and their respective lengths.

        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> results = dctx.multi_decompress_to_buffer([b'...', b'...'])

        The decompressed size of each frame MUST be discoverable. It can either be
        embedded within the zstd frame or passed in via the ``decompressed_sizes``
        argument.

        The ``decompressed_sizes`` argument is an object conforming to the buffer
        protocol which holds an array of 64-bit unsigned integers in the machine's
        native format defining the decompressed sizes of each frame. If this argument
        is passed, it avoids having to scan each frame for its decompressed size.
        This frame scanning can add noticeable overhead in some scenarios.

        >>> frames = [...]
        >>> sizes = struct.pack('=QQQQ', len0, len1, len2, len3)
        >>>
        >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
        >>> results = dctx.multi_decompress_to_buffer(frames, decompressed_sizes=sizes)

        .. note::

           It is possible to pass a ``mmap.mmap()`` instance into this function by
           wrapping it with a ``BufferWithSegments`` instance (which will define the
           offsets of frames within the memory mapped region).

        This function is logically equivalent to performing
        :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.decompress` on each input frame and returning the
        result.

        This function exists to perform decompression on multiple frames as fast
        as possible by having as little overhead as possible. Since decompression is
        performed as a single operation and since the decompressed output is stored in
        a single buffer, extra memory allocations, Python objects, and Python function
        calls are avoided. This is ideal for scenarios where callers know up front that
        they need to access data for multiple frames, such as when  *delta chains* are
        being used.

        Currently, the implementation always spawns multiple threads when requested,
        even if the amount of work to do is small. In the future, it will be smarter
        about avoiding threads and their associated overhead when the amount of
        work to do is small.

        :param frames:
           Source defining zstd frames to decompress.
        :param decompressed_sizes:
           Array of integers representing sizes of decompressed zstd frames.
        :param threads:
           How many threads to use for decompression operations.

           Negative values will use the same number of threads as logical CPUs
           on the machine. Values ``0`` or ``1`` use a single thread.

    aBufferSegmenta__qualname__uBufferSegment.offseta__len__uBufferSegment.__len__atobytesuBufferSegment.tobytesTuRepresents an array of ``(offset, length)`` integers.

    This type is effectively an index used by :py:class:`BufferWithSegments`.

    The array members are 64-bit unsigned integers using host/native bit order.

    Instances conform to the buffer protocol.
    aBufferSegmentsuA memory buffer containing N discrete items of known lengths.

    This type is essentially a fixed size memory address and an array
    of 2-tuples of ``(offset, length)`` 64-bit unsigned native-endian
    integers defining the byte offset and length of each segment within
    the buffer.

    Instances behave like containers.

    Instances also conform to the buffer protocol. So a reference to the
    backing bytes can be obtained via ``memoryview(o)``. A *copy* of the
    backing bytes can be obtained via ``.tobytes()``.

    This type exists to facilitate operations against N>1 items without
    the overhead of Python object creation and management. Used with
    APIs like :py:meth:`ZstdDecompressor.multi_decompress_to_buffer`, it
    is possible to decompress many objects in parallel without the GIL

    If the object is composed of 2 ``BufferWithSegments`` instances with the
    first having 2 segments and the second have 3 segments, then ``b[0]``
    and ``b[1]`` access segments in the first object and ``b[2]``, ``b[3]``,
    and ``b[4]`` access segments from the second.

    This type represents a collection of parameters to control how zstd
    compression is performed.

    Instances can be constructed from raw parameters or derived from a
    base set of defaults specified from a compression level (recommended)
    via :py:meth:`ZstdCompressionParameters.from_level`.

    >>> # Derive compression settings for compression level 7.
    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters.from_level(7)

    >>> # With an input size of 1MB
    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters.from_level(7, source_size=1048576)

    Using ``from_level()``, it is also possible to override individual compression
    parameters or to define additional settings that aren't automatically derived.
    e.g.:

    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters.from_level(4, window_log=10)
    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters.from_level(5, threads=4)

    Or you can define low-level compression settings directly:

    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters(window_log=12, enable_ldm=True)

    Once a ``ZstdCompressionParameters`` instance is obtained, it can be used to
    configure a compressor:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor(compression_params=params)

    Some of these are very low-level settings. It may help to consult the official
    zstandard documentation for their behavior. Look for the ``ZSTD_p_*`` constants
    in ``zstd.h`` (https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/lib/zstd.h).

    ``ZstdCompressionWriter`` is a write-only stream interface for writing
    compressed data to another stream.

    This type conforms to the ``io.RawIOBase`` interface and should be usable
    by any type that operates against a *file-object* (``typing.BinaryIO``
    in Python type hinting speak). Only methods that involve writing will do
    useful things.

    As data is written to this stream (e.g. via ``write()``), that data
    is sent to the compressor. As compressed data becomes available from
    the compressor, it is sent to the underlying stream by calling its
    ``write()`` method.

    Both ``write()`` and ``flush()`` return the number of bytes written to the
    object's ``write()``. In many cases, small inputs do not accumulate enough
    data to cause a write and ``write()`` will return ``0``.

    Calling ``close()`` will mark the stream as closed and subsequent I/O
    operations will raise ``ValueError`` (per the documented behavior of
    ``io.RawIOBase``). ``close()`` will also call ``close()`` on the underlying
    stream if such a method exists and the instance was constructed with
    ``closefd=True``

    Instances are obtained by calling :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_writer`.

    Typically usage is as follows:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor(level=10)
    >>> compressor = cctx.stream_writer(fh)
    >>> compressor.write(b"chunk 0\n")
    >>> compressor.write(b"chunk 1\n")
    >>> compressor.flush()
    >>> # Receiver will be able to decode ``chunk 0\nchunk 1\n`` at this point.
    >>> # Receiver is also expecting more data in the zstd *frame*.
    >>>
    >>> compressor.write(b"chunk 2\n")
    >>> compressor.flush(zstandard.FLUSH_FRAME)
    >>> # Receiver will be able to decode ``chunk 0\nchunk 1\nchunk 2``.
    >>> # Receiver is expecting no more data, as the zstd frame is closed.
    >>> # Any future calls to ``write()`` at this point will construct a new
    >>> # zstd frame.

    Instances can be used as context managers. Exiting the context manager is
    the equivalent of calling ``close()``, which is equivalent to calling
    ``flush(zstandard.FLUSH_FRAME)``:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor(level=10)
    >>> with cctx.stream_writer(fh) as compressor:
    ...     compressor.write(b'chunk 0')
    ...     compressor.write(b'chunk 1')
    ...     ...

    .. important::

       If ``flush(FLUSH_FRAME)`` is not called, emitted data doesn't
       constitute a full zstd *frame* and consumers of this data may complain
       about malformed input. It is recommended to use instances as a context
       manager to ensure *frames* are properly finished.

    If the size of the data being fed to this streaming compressor is known,
    you can declare it before compression begins:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> with cctx.stream_writer(fh, size=data_len) as compressor:
    ...     compressor.write(chunk0)
    ...     compressor.write(chunk1)
    ...     ...

    Declaring the size of the source data allows compression parameters to
    be tuned. And if ``write_content_size`` is used, it also results in the
    content size being written into the frame header of the output data.

    The size of chunks being ``write()`` to the destination can be specified:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> with cctx.stream_writer(fh, write_size=32768) as compressor:
    ...     ...

    To see how much memory is being used by the streaming compressor:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> with cctx.stream_writer(fh) as compressor:
    ...     ...
    ...     byte_size = compressor.memory_size()

    Thte total number of bytes written so far are exposed via ``tell()``:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> with cctx.stream_writer(fh) as compressor:
    ...     ...
    ...     total_written = compressor.tell()

    ``stream_writer()`` accepts a ``write_return_read`` boolean argument to
    control the return value of ``write()``. When ``False`` (the default),
    ``write()`` returns the number of bytes that were ``write()``'en to the
    underlying object. When ``True``, ``write()`` returns the number of bytes
    read from the input that were subsequently written to the compressor.
    ``True`` is the *proper* behavior for ``write()`` as specified by the
    ``io.RawIOBase`` interface and will become the default value in a future
    release.

    This type implements an API similar to compression types in Python's
    standard library such as ``zlib.compressobj`` and ``bz2.BZ2Compressor``.
    This enables existing code targeting the standard library API to swap
    in this type to achieve zstd compression.

    .. important::

       The design of this API is not ideal for optimal performance.

       The reason performance is not optimal is because the API is limited to
       returning a single buffer holding compressed data. When compressing
       data, we don't know how much data will be emitted. So in order to
       capture all this data in a single buffer, we need to perform buffer
       reallocations and/or extra memory copies. This can add significant
       overhead depending on the size or nature of the compressed data how
       much your application calls this type.

       If performance is critical, consider an API like
       :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_reader`,
       :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_writer`,
       :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.chunker`, or
       :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.read_to_iter`, which result in less overhead
       managing buffers.

    Instances are obtained by calling :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.compressobj`.

    Here is how this API should be used:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> cobj = cctx.compressobj()
    >>> data = cobj.compress(b"raw input 0")
    >>> data = cobj.compress(b"raw input 1")
    >>> data = cobj.flush()

    Or to flush blocks:

    >>> cctx.zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> cobj = cctx.compressobj()
    >>> data = cobj.compress(b"chunk in first block")
    >>> data = cobj.flush(zstandard.COMPRESSOBJ_FLUSH_BLOCK)
    >>> data = cobj.compress(b"chunk in second block")
    >>> data = cobj.flush()

    For best performance results, keep input chunks under 256KB. This avoids
    extra allocations for a large output object.

    It is possible to declare the input size of the data that will be fed
    into the compressor:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> cobj = cctx.compressobj(size=6)
    >>> data = cobj.compress(b"foobar")
    >>> data = cobj.flush()
    uZstdCompressionObj.compressuZstdCompressionObj.flushuCompress data to uniformly sized chunks.

    This type allows you to iteratively feed chunks of data into a compressor
    and produce output chunks of uniform size.

    ``compress()``, ``flush()``, and ``finish()`` all return an iterator of
    ``bytes`` instances holding compressed data. The iterator may be empty.
    Callers MUST iterate through all elements of the returned iterator before
    performing another operation on the object or else the compressor's
    internal state may become confused. This can result in an exception being
    raised or malformed data being emitted.

    All chunks emitted by ``compress()`` will have a length of the configured
    chunk size.

    ``flush()`` and ``finish()`` may return a final chunk smaller than
    the configured chunk size.

    Instances are obtained by calling :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.chunker`.

    Here is how the API should be used:

    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    >>> chunker = cctx.chunker(chunk_size=32768)
    >>>
    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     while True:
    ...         in_chunk = fh.read(32768)
    ...         if not in_chunk:
    ...             break
    ...
    ...         for out_chunk in chunker.compress(in_chunk):
    ...             # Do something with output chunk of size 32768.
    ...
    ...     for out_chunk in chunker.finish():
    ...         # Do something with output chunks that finalize the zstd frame.

    This compressor type is often a better alternative to
    :py:class:`ZstdCompressor.compressobj` because it has better performance
    properties.

    ``compressobj()`` will emit output data as it is available. This results
    in a *stream* of output chunks of varying sizes. The consistency of the
    output chunk size with ``chunker()`` is more appropriate for many usages,
    such as sending compressed data to a socket.

    ``compressobj()`` may also perform extra memory reallocations in order
    to dynamically adjust the sizes of the output chunks. Since ``chunker()``
    output chunks are all the same size (except for flushed or final chunks),
    there is less memory allocation/copying overhead.
    uZstdCompressionChunker.__init__uReadable compressing stream wrapper.

    ``ZstdCompressionReader`` is a read-only stream interface for obtaining
    compressed data from a source.

    This type conforms to the ``io.RawIOBase`` interface and should be usable
    by any type that operates against a *file-object* (``typing.BinaryIO``
    in Python type hinting speak).

    Instances are neither writable nor seekable (even if the underlying
    source is seekable). ``readline()`` and ``readlines()`` are not implemented
    because they don't make sense for compressed data. ``tell()`` returns the
    number of compressed bytes emitted so far.

    Instances are obtained by calling :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_reader`.

    In this example, we open a file for reading and then wrap that file
    handle with a stream from which compressed data can be ``read()``.

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    ...     reader = cctx.stream_reader(fh)
    ...     while True:
    ...         chunk = reader.read(16384)
    ...         if not chunk:
    ...             break
    ...
    ...         # Do something with compressed chunk.

    Instances can also be used as context managers:

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    ...     with cctx.stream_reader(fh) as reader:
    ...         while True:
    ...             chunk = reader.read(16384)
    ...             if not chunk:
    ...                 break
    ...
    ...             # Do something with compressed chunk.

    When the context manager exits or ``close()`` is called, the stream is
    closed, underlying resources are released, and future operations against
    the compression stream will fail.

    ``stream_reader()`` accepts a ``size`` argument specifying how large the
    input stream is. This is used to adjust compression parameters so they are
    tailored to the source size. e.g.

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    ...     with cctx.stream_reader(fh, size=os.stat(path).st_size) as reader:
    ...         ...

    If the ``source`` is a stream, you can specify how large ``read()``
    requests to that stream should be via the ``read_size`` argument.
    It defaults to ``zstandard.COMPRESSION_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_SIZE``. e.g.

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor()
    ...     # Will perform fh.read(8192) when obtaining data to feed into the
    ...     # compressor.
    ...     with cctx.stream_reader(fh, read_size=8192) as reader:

    Create an object used to perform Zstandard compression.

    Each instance is essentially a wrapper around a ``ZSTD_CCtx`` from
    zstd's C API.

    An instance can compress data various ways. Instances can be used
    multiple times. Each compression operation will use the compression
    parameters defined at construction time.

    .. note:

       When using a compression dictionary and multiple compression
       operations are performed, the ``ZstdCompressionParameters`` derived
       from an integer compression ``level`` and the first compressed data's
       size will be reused for all subsequent operations. This may not be
       desirable if source data sizes vary significantly.

    ``compression_params`` is mutually exclusive with ``level``,
    ``write_checksum``, ``write_content_size``, ``write_dict_id``, and
    ``threads``.

    Assume that each ``ZstdCompressor`` instance can only handle a single
    logical compression operation at the same time. i.e. if you call a method
    like ``stream_reader()`` to obtain multiple objects derived from the same
    ``ZstdCompressor`` instance and attempt to use them simultaneously, errors
    will likely occur.

    If you need to perform multiple logical compression operations and you
    can't guarantee those operations are temporally non-overlapping, you need
    to obtain multiple ``ZstdCompressor`` instances.

    Unless specified otherwise, assume that no two methods of
    ``ZstdCompressor`` instances can be called from multiple Python
    threads simultaneously. In other words, assume instances are not thread safe
    unless stated otherwise.

    :param level:
       Integer compression level. Valid values are all negative integers
       through 22. Lower values generally yield faster operations with lower
       compression ratios. Higher values are generally slower but compress
       better. The default is 3, which is what the ``zstd`` CLI uses. Negative
       levels effectively engage ``--fast`` mode from the ``zstd`` CLI.
    :param dict_data:
       A ``ZstdCompressionDict`` to be used to compress with dictionary
        data.
    :param compression_params:
       A ``ZstdCompressionParameters`` instance defining low-level compression
       parameters. If defined, this will overwrite the ``level`` argument.
    :param write_checksum:
       If True, a 4 byte content checksum will be written with the compressed
       data, allowing the decompressor to perform content verification.
    :param write_content_size:
       If True (the default), the decompressed content size will be included
       in the header of the compressed data. This data will only be written if
       the compressor knows the size of the input data.
    :param write_dict_id:
       Determines whether the dictionary ID will be written into the compressed
       data. Defaults to True. Only adds content to the compressed data if
       a dictionary is being used.
    :param threads:
       Number of threads to use to compress data concurrently. When set,
       compression operations are performed on multiple threads. The default
       value (0) disables multi-threaded compression. A value of ``-1`` means
       to set the number of threads to the number of detected logical CPUs.

    Instances have the following attributes:

    ``content_size``
       Integer size of original, uncompressed content. This will be ``0`` if the
       original content size isn't written to the frame (controlled with the
       ``write_content_size`` argument to ``ZstdCompressor``) or if the input
       content size was ``0``.

    ``window_size``
       Integer size of maximum back-reference distance in compressed data.

    ``dict_id``
       Integer of dictionary ID used for compression. ``0`` if no dictionary
       ID was used or if the dictionary ID was ``0``.

    ``has_checksum``
       Bool indicating whether a 4 byte content checksum is stored at the end
       of the frame.
    uFrameParameters.__init__aframe_content_sizeaframe_header_sizeaget_frame_parametersuRepresents a computed compression dictionary.

    Instances are obtained by calling :py:func:`train_dictionary` or by
    passing bytes obtained from another source into the constructor.

    Instances can be constructed from bytes:

    >>> dict_data = zstandard.ZstdCompressionDict(data)

    It is possible to construct a dictionary from *any* data. If the data
    doesn't begin with a magic header, it will be treated as a *prefix*
    dictionary. *Prefix* dictionaries allow compression operations to
    reference raw data within the dictionary.

    It is possible to force the use of *prefix* dictionaries or to require
    a dictionary header:

    >>> dict_data = zstandard.ZstdCompressionDict(data, dict_type=zstandard.DICT_TYPE_RAWCONTENT)
    >>> dict_data = zstandard.ZstdCompressionDict(data, dict_type=zstandard.DICT_TYPE_FULLDICT)

    You can see how many bytes are in the dictionary by calling ``len()``:

    >>> dict_data = zstandard.train_dictionary(size, samples)
    >>> dict_size = len(dict_data)  # will not be larger than ``size``

    Once you have a dictionary, you can pass it to the objects performing
    compression and decompression:

    >>> dict_data = zstandard.train_dictionary(131072, samples)
    >>> cctx = zstandard.ZstdCompressor(dict_data=dict_data)
    >>> for source_data in input_data:
    ...     compressed = cctx.compress(source_data)
    ...     # Do something with compressed data.
    ...
    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor(dict_data=dict_data)
    >>> for compressed_data in input_data:
    ...     buffer = io.BytesIO()
    ...     with dctx.stream_writer(buffer) as decompressor:
    ...         decompressor.write(compressed_data)
    ...         # Do something with raw data in ``buffer``.

    Dictionaries have unique integer IDs. You can retrieve this ID via:

    >>> dict_id = zstandard.dictionary_id(dict_data)

    You can obtain the raw data in the dict (useful for persisting and constructing
    a ``ZstdCompressionDict`` later) via ``as_bytes()``:

    >>> dict_data = zstandard.train_dictionary(size, samples)
    >>> raw_data = dict_data.as_bytes()

    By default, when a ``ZstdCompressionDict`` is *attached* to a
    ``ZstdCompressor``, each ``ZstdCompressor`` performs work to prepare the
    dictionary for use. This is fine if only 1 compression operation is being
    performed or if the ``ZstdCompressor`` is being reused for multiple operations.
    But if multiple ``ZstdCompressor`` instances are being used with the dictionary,
    this can add overhead.

    It is possible to *precompute* the dictionary so it can readily be consumed
    by multiple ``ZstdCompressor`` instances:

    >>> d = zstandard.ZstdCompressionDict(data)
    >>> # Precompute for compression level 3.
    >>> d.precompute_compress(level=3)
    >>> # Precompute with specific compression parameters.
    >>> params = zstandard.ZstdCompressionParameters(...)
    >>> d.precompute_compress(compression_params=params)

    .. note::

       When a dictionary is precomputed, the compression parameters used to
       precompute the dictionary overwrite some of the compression parameters
       specified to ``ZstdCompressor``.

    :param data:
       Dictionary data.
    :param dict_type:
       Type of dictionary. One of the ``DICT_TYPE_*`` constants.

lppZlpppppatrain_dictionaryuA standard library API compatible decompressor.

    This type implements a compressor that conforms to the API by other
    decompressors in Python's standard library. e.g. ``zlib.decompressobj``
    or ``bz2.BZ2Decompressor``. This allows callers to use zstd compression
    while conforming to a similar API.

    Compressed data chunks are fed into ``decompress(data)`` and
    uncompressed output (or an empty bytes) is returned. Output from
    subsequent calls needs to be concatenated to reassemble the full
    decompressed byte sequence.

    If ``read_across_frames=False``, each instance is single use: once an
    input frame is decoded, ``decompress()`` will raise an exception. If
    ``read_across_frames=True``, instances can decode multiple frames.

    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> dobj = dctx.decompressobj()
    >>> data = dobj.decompress(compressed_chunk_0)
    >>> data = dobj.decompress(compressed_chunk_1)

    By default, calls to ``decompress()`` write output data in chunks of size
    ``DECOMPRESSION_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_SIZE``. These chunks are concatenated
    before being returned to the caller. It is possible to define the size of
    these temporary chunks by passing ``write_size`` to ``decompressobj()``:

    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> dobj = dctx.decompressobj(write_size=1048576)

    .. note::

       Because calls to ``decompress()`` may need to perform multiple
       memory (re)allocations, this streaming decompression API isn't as
       efficient as other APIs.

    This type provides a read-only stream interface for performing transparent
    decompression from another stream or data source. It conforms to the
    ``io.RawIOBase`` interface. Only methods relevant to reading are
    implemented.

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> reader = dctx.stream_reader(fh)
    >>> while True:
    ...     chunk = reader.read(16384)
    ...     if not chunk:
    ...         break
    ...     # Do something with decompressed chunk.

    The stream can also be used as a context manager:

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    ...     with dctx.stream_reader(fh) as reader:
    ...         ...

    When used as a context manager, the stream is closed and the underlying
    resources are released when the context manager exits. Future operations
    against the stream will fail.

    The ``source`` argument to ``stream_reader()`` can be any object with a
    ``read(size)`` method or any object implementing the *buffer protocol*.

    If the ``source`` is a stream, you can specify how large ``read()`` requests
    to that stream should be via the ``read_size`` argument. It defaults to
    ``zstandard.DECOMPRESSION_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_SIZE``.:

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    ...     # Will perform fh.read(8192) when obtaining data for the decompressor.
    ...     with dctx.stream_reader(fh, read_size=8192) as reader:
    ...         ...

    Instances are *partially* seekable. Absolute and relative positions
    (``SEEK_SET`` and ``SEEK_CUR``) forward of the current position are
    allowed. Offsets behind the current read position and offsets relative
    to the end of stream are not allowed and will raise ``ValueError``
    if attempted.

    ``tell()`` returns the number of decompressed bytes read so far.

    Not all I/O methods are implemented. Notably missing is support for
    ``readline()``, ``readlines()``, and linewise iteration support. This is
    because streams operate on binary data - not text data. If you want to
    convert decompressed output to text, you can chain an ``io.TextIOWrapper``
    to the stream:

    >>> with open(path, 'rb') as fh:
    ...     dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    ...     stream_reader = dctx.stream_reader(fh)
    ...     text_stream = io.TextIOWrapper(stream_reader, encoding='utf-8')
    ...     for line in text_stream:
    ...         ...

    Write-only stream wrapper that performs decompression.

    This type provides a writable stream that performs decompression and writes
    decompressed data to another stream.

    This type implements the ``io.RawIOBase`` interface. Only methods that
    involve writing will do useful things.

    Behavior is similar to :py:meth:`ZstdCompressor.stream_writer`: compressed
    data is sent to the decompressor by calling ``write(data)`` and decompressed
    output is written to the inner stream by calling its ``write(data)``
    method:

    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> decompressor = dctx.stream_writer(fh)
    >>> # Will call fh.write() with uncompressed data.
    >>> decompressor.write(compressed_data)

    Instances can be used as context managers. However, context managers add no
    extra special behavior other than automatically calling ``close()`` when
    they exit.

    Calling ``close()`` will mark the stream as closed and subsequent I/O
    operations will raise ``ValueError`` (per the documented behavior of
    ``io.RawIOBase``). ``close()`` will also call ``close()`` on the
    underlying stream if such a method exists and the instance was created with
    ``closefd=True``.

    The size of chunks to ``write()`` to the destination can be specified:

    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> with dctx.stream_writer(fh, write_size=16384) as decompressor:
    >>>    pass

    You can see how much memory is being used by the decompressor:

    >>> dctx = zstandard.ZstdDecompressor()
    >>> with dctx.stream_writer(fh) as decompressor:
    >>>    byte_size = decompressor.memory_size()

    ``stream_writer()`` accepts a ``write_return_read`` boolean argument to control
    the return value of ``write()``. When ``True`` (the default)``, ``write()``
    returns the number of bytes that were read from the input. When ``False``,
    ``write()`` returns the number of bytes that were ``write()`` to the inner
    stream.

    Context for performing zstandard decompression.

    Each instance is essentially a wrapper around a ``ZSTD_DCtx`` from zstd's
    C API.

    An instance can compress data various ways. Instances can be used multiple
    times.

    The interface of this class is very similar to
    :py:class:`zstandard.ZstdCompressor` (by design).

    Assume that each ``ZstdDecompressor`` instance can only handle a single
    logical compression operation at the same time. i.e. if you call a method
    like ``decompressobj()`` to obtain multiple objects derived from the same
    ``ZstdDecompressor`` instance and attempt to use them simultaneously, errors
    will likely occur.

    If you need to perform multiple logical decompression operations and you
    can't guarantee those operations are temporally non-overlapping, you need
    to obtain multiple ``ZstdDecompressor`` instances.

    Unless specified otherwise, assume that no two methods of
    ``ZstdDecompressor`` instances can be called from multiple Python
    threads simultaneously. In other words, assume instances are not thread safe
    unless stated otherwise.

    :param max_window_size:
       Sets an upper limit on the window size for decompression operations in

       for inputs using large compression windows.
    :param format:
       Set the format of data for the decoder.

       By default this is ``zstandard.FORMAT_ZSTD1``. It can be set to
       ``zstandard.FORMAT_ZSTD1_MAGICLESS`` to allow decoding frames without
       the 4 byte magic header. Not all decompression APIs support this mode.

    TalevelacompressuCompress source data using the zstd compression format.

    This performs one-shot compression using basic/default compression
    settings.

    This method is provided for convenience and is equivalent to calling
    ``ZstdCompressor(level=level).compress(data)``.

    If you find yourself calling this function in a tight loop,
    performance will be greater if you construct a single ``ZstdCompressor``
    and repeatedly call ``compress()`` on it.
    adecompressTamax_output_sizeuDecompress a zstd frame into its original data.

    This performs one-shot decompression using basic/default compression
    settings.

    This method is provided for convenience and is equivalent to calling
    ``ZstdDecompressor().decompress(data, max_output_size=max_output_size)``.

    If you find yourself calling this function in a tight loop, performance
    will be greater if you construct a single ``ZstdDecompressor`` and
    repeatedly call ``decompress()`` on it.
